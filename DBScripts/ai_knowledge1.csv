共鸣,Conarium,Conarium 是一款令人毛骨悚然的洛夫克拉夫特式游戏，讲述了四位科学家的扣人心弦的故事，以及他们努力挑战我们通常认为的自然界“绝对”极限的努力。灵感来自 HP Lovecraft 的中篇小说 At the Mountains of Madness，但主要以原始故事为背景。你扮演弗兰克·吉尔曼 （Frank Gilman），在一个充满奇怪、脉动噪音的房间里睁开眼睛。灯光图案在墙壁上表演 Danse Macabre，由桌子上的一个酷儿装置呈现。只记得你身在南极附近的南极基地乌普奥特，你发现这个地方空无一人，并有一种明显的感觉，觉得有什么事情非常不对劲。不知何故，知道你的记忆无法引导你，会强化一种奇怪的脆弱感，一种熟悉而又陌生的感觉，即成为一个奇特整体的一部分......很快你会发现，在探险期间使用该设备后，你已经死了，但随后又微妙地改变了，谈到了奇怪的回忆和奇怪的地方。你失去了一些重要的东西或获得了什么险恶的东西......探索南极基地，以及梦想和愿景。研究线索并解开秘密，同时不惜一切代价避开可怕的生物。主要特点： 一个深刻而充满悬念的洛夫克拉夫特式故事，有很多秘密和复活节彩蛋。使用虚幻引擎 4 创建的不祥但美妙的图形。多个结局。令人难以忘怀且大气的配乐。Conarium 由虚幻引擎 4 提供支持，旨在带来尖端的视觉效果，带来更加身临其境的故事讲述和游戏体验。,"Conarium is a chilling Lovecraftian game that follows the gripping story of four scientists and their endeavour to challenge what we normally consider to be the 'absolute' limits of nature. Inspired by H.P. Lovecraft's novella At the Mountains of Madness, but largely set after the original story. You, as Frank Gilman, open your eyes inside a room filled with strange, pulsating noises. Patterns of lights executing a Danse Macabre on the walls is presented by a queer device on the table. Having recalled nothing other than that you’re in Upuaut, an Antarctic base located near the South Pole, you find the place deserted and have a distinct feeling of something being terribly wrong. Somehow knowing that your memories cannot guide you enforces a strange feeling of vulnerability, a familiar yet alien sensation of being a part of a peculiar whole... Soon you will discover that having used the device during the expedition, you have died but then returned subtly changed, speaking of strange memories and of strange places. You have lost something important or gained something sinister... Explore the Antarctic base, as well as dreams and visions. Study clues and unlock secrets, whilst avoiding macabre beings at all cost. Key features: A deep and suspense-filled Lovecraftian story with lots of secrets and Easter eggs. Ominous but wonderful graphics created with Unreal Engine 4. Multiple endings. A haunting and atmospheric soundtrack. Powered by Unreal Engine 4, Conarium aims to bring cutting-edge visuals for a more immersive storytelling and gaming experience.","“编辑之选。HP Lovecraft 的恐怖片很难适应电子游戏格式,但 Conarium 成功了。它很好地处理了它的主题和参考资料,提供了一种既令人不安又令人着迷的体验。100% – Monstervine “它有很多亮点,最重要的是,它让我坐立不安。没有多少游戏能做到这一点。95% – Geeknifty “晚上戴着耳机独自玩,享受压抑和险恶的气氛。”雷康布","“EDITOR'S CHOICE.

方块谜阵2,Blockwick 2,Blockwick 是一个到处都是五颜六色的方块的混乱世界。连接板上所有相同颜色的块。蓝色与蓝色、红色与红色，依此类推。不过，不要担心白色板条箱——它们只会碍事。如果你被一个谜题困住了，不要担心。只需寻找隐藏的月亮珍珠。在拼图中找到月亮珍珠将允许您打开下一个拼图。你前进得越远，你遇到的特殊块就越多。有些被螺栓固定并永久卡住。有些方块处于休眠状态，在被唤醒之前无法移动（在它旁边放一个相同颜色的方块来唤醒它）。纠缠的块通过量子力连接在一起——当一个块移动时，其他块也会移动。纠缠的块共享相同的符号。最终，你会遇到更多狡猾的块。粘性块很粘，会粘在其他块上。你不能直接捡到他们;它们只能与其他物块和板条箱一起推拉。毛毛虫块像火车一样相互连接;它们只能随头部或尾部移动。催眠块不需要连接来解决难题，但它们会造成很多痛苦。如果你在它旁边放置一个，催眠会让任何有色的块进入睡眠状态。最后，翻转块有六个边。当您移动它们时，它们会翻转到不同的一侧，露出新的颜色。哦，你注意到地上那些奇怪的字形了吗？每个谜题有三个。尝试用一组链接的块将它们全部覆盖起来以掌握拼图。这会更棘手，但对你的大脑有好处。就是这样。玩得愉快！,"Blockwick is a jumbled world full of colorful blocks. Connect all same-colored blocks on the board. Blue with blue, red with red, and so on. Don’t worry about the white crates though—they just get in the way. If you get stuck on a puzzle, don’t fret. Just look for the hidden moon pearl. Finding the moon pearl in a puzzle will allow you to open the next puzzle. The further you progress the more special blocks you’ll meet. Some are bolted down and are permanently stuck. Some blocks are asleep and can’t move until they’re woken up (set down a same-colored block next to it to wake it up). Entangled blocks are connected together by quantum forces—when one moves so do the others. Blocks that are entangled share the same symbol. Eventually you’ll meet even more devious blocks. Sticky blocks are gooey and will stick to other blocks. You can't pick them up directly; they can only be pushed and pulled around with other blocks and crates. Caterpillar blocks are linked to each other like a train; they can only be moved with the head or the tail. Hypno blocks don’t need to be connected to solve a puzzle, but they’ll cause a lot of pain. The hypno puts any colored block to sleep if you set one down right next to it. Finally, flip blocks have six sides. When you move them, they flip to a different side, exposing a new color. Oh, did you notice the strange glyphs on the ground? Each puzzle has three. Try to cover them all up with groups of linked blocks to master the puzzle. It’ll be more tricky, but it’s good for your brain. That’s about it.

However, instead of discovering paradise, the inhabitants of The Infinity unlocked the door to a long forgotten nightmare. Deep inside this leviathan something terrible hunts, out of myth and legend the last werewolf stalks the ship. Infinity Runner centres on a prisoner desperately trying to escape the decaying ship and the clutches of the terror within. It’s a sci-fi action running game for PC, Mac, and Linux that features 14 action packed levels, Oculus Rift DK1 &amp; DK2 (Runtime 4.4) support and online multi-player. In Infinity Runner, the player controls the protagonist, the prisoner, from a first-person perspective as he is challenged to escape from the gargantuan spaceship. This is accomplished by use of techniques and movements inspired by the disciplines of parkour and mixed martial arts, the game-play conveys the players strain and physical contact with the environment whilst dealing with the constantly changing and expansive surroundings. As well as these evasive elements there’s also combat sections in the game where a dynamic targeting system is used which calls for fast reflex combinations. The game supports the latest virtual reality technology as well as having multi-player mode which enables up to 32 people to play head to head. Even though it’s a slick action game the story is very important part of your journey, as well as being your call to action it will reveal revelations along your action packed ride. Some of the story is told at high pace but there are some slower paced transition sections at the end of each level where we develop the narrative for the player. Without giving too much away you have someone guiding you through the game who talks to you telepathically. Their role is not only to orientate you but to help unfold the story for the player as you find out who you are and why you’re on the ship. The Oculus Rift mode literally transports you inside the Infinity spaceship to be totally immersed in the thick of the action. The game-play is designed to complement the VR mode so you get the best experience possible and it enhances the game by adding another dimension to the playing experience. There is also another feature that transforms the game into a unique experience, the multi-player mode. This allows up to a 32 players to battle it out head to head to find out who’s the ultimate Infinity Runner. Infinity Runner packs a lot into one super slick sci-fi action game bundle and with it re-invents the running genre! FEATURES * WEREWOLVES IN SPACE! * 14 ACTION PACKED LEVELS * ARCADE MODE * STORY-MODE * OCULUS RIFT MODE (DK1 - DK2 Runtime 4.4) * WOLF LEVELLING SYSTEM * MULTI-PLAYER MODE WITH UP TO 32 PLAYERS STARSHIP INFINITY SPECIFICATION Over 150 miles long and nearly 30 miles in diameter at its widest point, the progress of The Infinity's construction at the Tranquillity Ship yards on the Moon could clearly be seen from Earth. The revolutionary ship requires a crew of 5,000,000 people to keep it running and is designed to house another 10 million people as general population ready for the colonisation of new worlds. The Bio-domes, seen along the side of the ship, house forests that cover nearly 60,000 square miles in total, providing oxygen and a food source for the population and an environment for rest and relaxation. The greatest technological achievement can be found in the engine room, which houses the revolutionary Infinity Drive. It is vastly smaller than previous engines at a mere 10 miles long and far more powerful than traditional models which would take up to a third of the length of a starship, creating space for more brave colonists heading out into the unknown.","“Infinity Runner 看起来不错,图形不错,具有强烈的科幻视觉风格......跑步本身令人震惊地愉快......以及它的乐趣令人惊讶。7/10 – Escapist 杂志 - Jim Sterling “Infinity Runner 在游戏进行中保持势头方面做得很好,定期为您提供新的危险,让您在最意想不到的时候保持警觉。”8/10 – The Indie Mine “Developers Wales Interactive 成功地融入了游戏玩家最基本的元素,乐趣” 8/10 – 游戏啪啪啪","“Infinity Runner looks good, with decent graphics and a strong sci-fi visual style....the running itself is shockingly enjoyable...and surprises in how fun it can be.” 7/10 – Escapist Magazine - Jim Sterling “Infinity Runner does a great job in maintaining its momentum as the game progresses, feeding you new hazards regularly to keep you on your toes when you least expect them.” 8/10 – The Indie Mine “Developers Wales Interactive successfully engage with the most basic element of a gamer, fun” 8/10 – Game Smack"

The Rings of Powder,The Rings of Powder,“The Rings of Powder”是一款有趣且具有讽刺意味的游戏，将探索与地下王国的建设以及实时战略和闲置元素相结合。游戏中的每个关卡都是程序生成的，这使得游戏可重玩。该游戏以多边形样式实现，因此尽管内容丰富，但它几乎可以在所有计算机和笔记本电脑上流畅运行。该项目是对一些传奇和不那么传奇的电影和现实场景的讽刺。该游戏的灵感来自某个系列，该系列扭曲了托尔金世界中的角色，但不足以成为一个好的模仿。我们公开说，我们的产品与托尔金的世界没有太多共同之处，人物的相似性纯属偶然。我们做一些电影和连续剧所做的事情，只是更多......我们的角色，无论多么可能与这些世界相关联，都是完全不同的角色。Gladamreal - 因为一个行为如此不理智的人不可能是真的。坎达夫 - 一个能的巫师。还有“聪明”的精灵 Rondel。这个游戏应该是温暖、有趣和讽刺的。一个轻松的实时策略，充满幽默感。,"'The Rings of Powder' is a fun and ironizing game combining exploration with the construction of an underground kingdom and elements of real-time strategy and idle. Each level in the game is procedurally generated, which makes the gameplay replayable. The game was implemented in a polygonal style so that despite the wealth of content it works smoothly on almost all computers and laptops. The project is an irony of both some legendary and less legendary movies and scenes from reality. The game was inspired by a certain series that distorts characters from Tolkien's world, but not enough to be a good parody. We say openly that our product does not have much in common with the world of Tolkien, and the similarity of the figures is purely accidental. We do what some movies and series do, only more... Our characters, however possibly associated with these worlds, are completely different characters. Gladamreal - because someone acting so irrational could not be real. Candalf - A wizard who can. And the 'wise' elf Rondel. The Game Is Meant to Be Warm, Funny and Ironic. A relaxing real-time strategy with plenty of humor.","“尽管它的战役很短,但 The Rings of Powder 提供了良好的可重玩性,并且可以生成一个随机的地牢。它也是一款有趣且令人上瘾的策略游戏。7/10 – 泽庞","“Even though it has a short campaign, The Rings of Powder offers good replayability and can generate a randomised dungeon. It’s also a fun and addictive Strategy game.” 7/10 – Zeepond"

Despite starting off with a curse, this is a light-hearted adventure, with an engaging plot, retro-styled pixel art graphics, and a wild menagerie of puns. Ghostory won the Best Student Project prize at Game Access 2016. In human form players can interact with levers, pick up keys, jump, and carry the backpack they'll have to leave behind when incorporeal. In ghost form, they can fly and pass through walls. Clever use of both forms is what will allow them to survive and escape the cave unscathed. The game comes packed with dozens of carefully-crafted levels meant to tax your logical and lateral thinking skills and is never afraid to introduce new mechanics and unique puzzles as players venture deeper into the cave. Ghostory, despite its simple controls, always remains challenging and keeps offering fresh, often multi-tier puzzles. Complex, occasionally fiendish puzzles. Dozens of unique levels. Smooth animations, and quality pixel art. Engagingly deep plot complete with rather silly puns. Atmospheric music to tie in with the detailed environments of each level. Smooth and responsive controls. Important mushrooms. In Ghostory, you take on the role of a lone traveler lost in the woods. Drinking water from a weird lake has placed a deadly curse on him, but also allowed him to transform into a ghost and fly - at will. Thankfully, an old and irritatingly funny lady can help him prepare the required antidote, but she will need a very special mushroom for this. A mushroom that only grows in a seemingly safe cave nearby. Surely, nothing can go wrong now.","“你喜欢益智游戏吗？那些随着你通过的关卡越多而变得越来越复杂的呢？那你就会爱上 Ghostory。8 – 游戏空间“如果您是益智平台游戏的粉丝并且想要一些具有挑战性的东西,那么 Ghostory 是一个不错的选择。”7.6 – EndWorldGaming “Ghostory 对于任何益智平台游戏类型的粉丝来说都是一个很好的补充。”7.5 – 基恩玩家","“Do you love puzzle games?

Come investigate more than 1,500 artworks made by A.I. across 7 carefully curated galleries. MoTU welcomes all to join in the journey of machine learning. MoTU engages all visitors through a gamified art experience. MoTU builds inclusive spaces for all humans to encounter the machine mind. The experience of MoTU is guided by four core principles: Gazing carefully at each artwork, you begin to notice familiar elements. Take a bold guess and type the words into the text box. Press enter to check for correct matches and earn points for each correct word. Don’t worry, guess as many times as you like. Any artworks you choose to skip for now will be shown again later. If unsure what you’re seeing, spend 10 points to reveal one word of the prompt. The progress you’ve made completing prompts will allow you to access certain gifts from the gift shop, where A.I. artworks are brought to life across a wide range of products. Don’t miss out! Completing the prompt for certain artworks will trigger A.I.-generated text descriptions of that artwork, allowing you the opportunity for an extra level down the rabbit-hole of machine-learning associations. More broad A.I.-generated statements on the future role of A.I. in art and society will also be found at the start of each gallery visit, slowly building a background narrative, subtly reframing what you are seeing as you progress. Unprompted is created by Matt Eshleman. The idea of Unprompted was born during the Shanghai COVID lockdown of spring 2022, when he was confined to his apartment for two months, making experimental games. During this time, Matt learned to both deeply fear and fully embrace the coming A.I. Unprompted can be enjoyed by both A.I. skeptics and fanatics alike. Unprompted is neither wholly human-made, nor wholly A.I.-generated. As such, the designer takes sole responsibility for the content of this game. Images were generated with Craiyon.

Gather inspiration in the form of cards and use it to build the narrative of your next show, but it's never quite that simple and whether dodging projectiles or surviving a sword fight, you've got to actually make it through the performance in one piece! A note from the Rainsdowne Tourist Board: Due to a faulty and irreversible weather charm several hundred years ago, the town of Rainsdowne does get an awful lot of rain, but don't let that dampen your spirits! There's lots to see and do around town: Try and sink some questionably depicted pirates at the cannon range. Take part in our lively card battling scene. There's always a tournament running.

乌鸦之影,In the Raven Shadow,In the Raven Shadow 在最好的意义上是一款适合所有寻求理智的人的老式冒险游戏。真正的复古 CINEMAX Developer Studio 成立于 1998 年。这是我们发布的第一款游戏。真正的复古。1999 年的原版游戏，没有重制版。捷克著名演员 Jí？í Lábus 的出色配音。/ 故事 塞维林是一位年轻的僧侣，他睡得很熟，而一些幽闭的弟子却在沉迷于成人文学。当他醒来并真正从男孩们那里拿走色情经文时，他自己也被他的住持指控犯下了最严重的罪过。修道院院长没有犹豫太久——我们身处黑暗的中世纪——试图斩首“魔鬼的爪牙”。Severin 只能通过无畏地跳出窗户来挽救他的生命（他为此戴上了 Rambo 围巾）。当他无意识地躺在地上时，他 - 就像以前一样 - 做了一些奇怪的梦，这些梦想以某种方式让他走上对生命意义的洞察之路......当他醒来时，他发现自己身处一片森林中，不知道下一步该做什么，但绝对决心要理解生命的感觉并找到自己的路。他将如何以精明、好奇心、母亲的智慧和厚脸皮来跟踪所有问题的问题，以及结果会是什么，我们将在这款冒险游戏中体验。总结In the Raven Shadow 在最好的情况下是一款老式的冒险游戏，适合所有寻求理智的人，他们可以自嘲。不仅腐朽房屋中的画作确实显示出一闪而过的眼睛。该游戏专为所有不想被牢牢抓住的人而设计：这是一个热点 - 与它互动，但更多：这里有很多可能性 - 想想！谜题难度中等。Severin 的故事没有错误。它将为游戏玩家提供大约 20+ 小时的娱乐和娱乐。,"In the Raven Shadow is in the best sense an old-fashioned adventure game for all sense-seeking people. True retro The CINEMAX Developer Studio was founded in 1998. This is our first released game. True retro. The original game of 1999, no remake. Excellent voice acting from the famous Czech actor Jí?í Lábus. / Story Severin is a young monk, who was sound sleeping, while some claustral disciples were disporting with adult literature. When he awakes and actually takes the erotic scripture from the boys, he himself is accused by his abbot of the worst sins. The abbot doesn't hesitate long - we are in the dark Middle Ages - trying to behead the 'devil's minion'. Severin can only save his life by a dauntless jump out of the window (he puts his Rambo scarf on for that). While he is lying unconsciously on the ground, he - like already before - dreams strange dreams, which want to bring him somehow on the road of insight about the meaning of life... When he awakes, he finds himself in a forest without a notion, what to do next, but absolutely determined to fathom the sense of life and find his way. How he will keep track of the question of all questions with shrewdness, curiosity, mother wit and a thick skin and what will be the result, we will experience in this adventure game. Summary In the Raven Shadow is in the best sense an old-fashioned adventure game for all sense-seeking people, which can laugh about themselves. And not only the painting in the decayed house does show a twinkle of the eye. The game is made for all those, who don't want to be taken firmly by the hand in the way: here is a hotspot - interact with it, but more: here are many possibilities - think! The puzzles are of medium difficulty. Severin's story runs error free. It will amuse and entertain the gamers for about 20+ hours.","“从最好的意义上说,In the Shadow of the Raven 是一款适合所有'寻求理智'的人的'老式'冒险游戏,他们可以自嘲。不仅腐朽房屋中的画作确实显示出一闪而过的眼睛。该游戏专为所有不想被牢牢抓住的人而设计：这是一个热点 - 与它互动,但更多：这里有很多可能性 - 想想！谜题难度中等。Severin 的故事没有错误。它将为游戏玩家提供大约 20+ 小时的娱乐和娱乐。74% – Adventurearchiv （2002 年 11 月 4 日） “而且,到最后,我得到了最重要的东西。游戏如何抓住你,又不让你。我认为它在这方面确实经过了彻底的测试。我在曼联和拜仁慕尼黑为冠军联赛的胜利而战的时候玩了它......游戏非常吸引人。这清楚吗？...这款游戏给我带来的意义远不止著名的 Dreamland。78% – EXCALIBUR,1999 年 6 月“当我回想起十几岁的 Gooka 是多么没有人情味时,或者我在阅读 Polda 的对话时感到多么尴尬时,赛车游戏 In the raven shadow 显然是赢家。”68% – 水平,1999 年 6 月","“In the Shadow of the Raven is in the best sense an 'old-fashioned' adventure game for all 'sense-seeking' people, which can laugh about themselves.

Grimshade,Grimshade,Grimshade 讲述了英雄们的故事，命运的转折涉及 Ree'fah 世界中发生的事件循环。许多可怕的怪物出没于布兰城周围的森林，高墙无法再保护居民免受攻击。邻国来势汹汹的军队突然降落在城市郊区，造成了严重破坏。救赎的希望渺茫——守军的力量已经耗尽，但国王和他忠诚的勇士们已经消失了。一连串的突如其来的事件和奇怪的巧合迫使人们采取行动。熟悉每一位英雄，并将他们团结起来——完全不同，有时是离奇和可怕的，与他们的动机相同，但所有人都有一个目标——找出发生在他们身上的事情的真正原因。带领冒险家们踏上旅程，探索一个多样而错综复杂的世界，结识新角色并揭开与情节相关的秘密。请记住，美丽是骗人的——危险无处不在。在具有挑战性的回合制战斗中测试您的技能，针对途中遇到的每个敌人调整您的战斗策略和最佳团队组合。主要特点 七个令人难忘的角色 ，包括黑孩子 Kiba、会说话的狙击獾 Charlie、戴着以太手套的勇敢家伙 Alister 和盗贼公主 Ruby。他们每个人都在战场上扮演着自己的角色（有时不止一个），在漫长的旅程中也有自己的使命。角色养成系统基于装备：每件盔甲、武器或配件都会为特定英雄提供独特的技能，扩大他们的攻击类型和防御提升的范围。寻找、交易或制作新设备来改善您的角色，使他们多才多艺且适应性强。复杂的战术回合制战斗：各种精心设计的敌人不会让您使用单一战术或无敌的团队构建来完成整个游戏。明智地选择您在战斗中带领的小队 - 正确的位置和意识对于您在与强大敌人的斗争中取得成功至关重要。Ree'fah 生动多样的世界：让自己沉浸在 Grimshade 的手绘奇幻世界中，在 20 多个小时的激动人心的旅程中发现令人印象深刻的历史。,"Grimshade tells the story of the company of heroes, by a twist of fate involved in the cycle of events unfolding in the world of Ree'fah. Numerous dreadful monsters infested the forest around the city of Brann and high walls could no longer protect residents from the attacks. The menacing army of the neighbouring kingdom suddenly landed on the outskirts of the city, wreaking havoc. There is no hope for salvation — the strength of the defenders is running low, but the King and his loyal Champions had vanished. Series of sudden events and odd coincidences force people to act. Get acquainted with each of the heroes and unite them — entirely different, sometimes bizarre and frightening, with their motives, but one purpose for all — to find out the real causes of what happened to them. Lead the group of the adventurers on a journey and explore a varied and intricate world, meet new characters and reveal plot-related secrets. Remember, beauty is deceptive — danger lurks everywhere. Test your skills in challenging turn-based battles, adjusting your combat tactics and optimal team combinations for each foe you met on the way. Key Features Seven memorable characters , including Kiba, the dark child, Charlie, the talking sniper badger, Alister, the brave guy with an Ether gauntlet, and Ruby, the princess of the thieves. Each of them has their role (sometimes more than one) on the battlefield and their own mission on a big journey. Character development system is based on equipment: each piece of armour, weapon or accessory gives a unique skill to a particular hero, expanding their range of attack types and defensive boosts. Find, trade for, or craft new equipment to improve your characters and make them versatile and adaptable. Complex tactical turn-based battles: a variety of elaborate enemies won't let you complete the whole game using a single tactic or invincible team build. Choose wisely the squad you take in a fight — proper positioning and awareness are essential to your success struggling against powerful foes. The vivid and diverse world of Ree'fah: immerse yourself in the hand-painted fantasy universe of Grimshade and discover an impressive history in more than 20 hours of an exciting journey.","“Grimshade 让您从最艰苦的战斗中取得胜利中获得真诚的快乐,这在其他现代战术角色扮演游戏中已经很长时间没有了。”Stopgame “它确实有一些超越标准的东西,无疑会让寻找战术 RPG 修复的玩家感到愉悦。”TechRaptor “很棒的回合制战斗系统,外观非常漂亮,有点简单,是《最终幻想战术》的一种独立复兴。”欧洲玩家","“Grimshade grants you a sincere pleasure from a victory in the hardest fight that didn't feel in other modern tactical RPGs for a long time.” Stopgame “It does have something a cut above the standard that will no doubt entertain players looking for a tactical RPG fix.” TechRaptor “Great turn-based fighting system in a really nice, a bit simple look, a kind of indie revival of Final Fantasy Tactics.” Eurogamer"

超空间之门,Hypergate,我能期待什么？Hypergate 包括一个 2 小时的单人战役，以及一个即时行动模式，用于构建您自己的自定义战斗场景。Instant Action 可以单人游戏或与朋友通过 LAN 玩。该活动包括一个简短的教程任务。在前几个任务中引入了额外的游戏机制。游戏包括 14 个不同的太空战斗地点、24 种不同的飞船升级（每个类别 6 个：盾牌、枪支、导弹和冷却剂）、6 个其他可升级的增强功能和 3 个战斗机可供飞行。支持第一人称和第三人称视角。敌人属于两个不同派系中的任何一个，包括战斗机、各种大小的炮塔、大型巡洋舰和增援门。最大的太空战斗可能包括数十艘巡洋舰和数百架战斗机。该游戏的客户评论指出，Hypergate 的战斗风格类似于 Freespace 2 或 Star Wars： X-Wing。Hypergate 包括完整的控制器、键盘和鼠标支持。可以自定义控件以适应玩家的偏好。显示器支持包括 13 种不同的分辨率，包括超宽屏幕格式。使用自动调平飞行，或手动控制俯仰、滚动和偏航。考虑到了大量玩家的反馈，以提供扎实的游戏内飞行体验。该游戏还包括 30 项 Steam 成就、全球 Steam 排行榜和 Steam 云存档，可在您的设备之间同步您的任务进度和升级。我不能期待什么？Hypergate 没有研磨、资源平衡或小行星采矿。只需点击三下鼠标，您就可以开始一项任务并通过击杀敌人来开始赚取积分。飞行方式是非牛顿的。（当前）不支持双 HOTAS。游戏有在线 DRM 吗？不。它曾经是，但最终在 2020 年 3 月应玩家要求被删除。最终，我希望玩家喜欢 Hypergate，而不是因为遇到互联网问题而受到惩罚。是否计划更新？是的。已发布两个主要更新： 内容更新 #1 和内容更新 #2 。这些更新中的大部分内容都是根据玩家的要求和兴趣来确定优先级的。内容更新 #3 的额外 2 小时单人战役任务目前正在开发中。内容更新 #3 的计划发布日期是 2021 年末的某个时间。更新是常规游戏更新，而不是单独的 DLC。想要了解更多信息？查看即将推出的内容和功能的最佳方式是查看我的 Twitter 页面 ，该页面几乎专门用于 Hypergate GIF。我大约每隔几天发布一次新的 GIF。同样，我的开发博客重点介绍了重要的更新并概述了我的开发理念。也请考虑加入新创建的 Hypergate Discord 服务器，与我自己或现有玩家讨论 Hypergate。,"What Can I Expect? Hypergate includes a 2-hour single-player campaign, and an Instant Action mode for building your own custom battle scenarios. Instant Action can be played single-player or over LAN with friends. The campaign includes a brief, simple tutorial mission. Additional game mechanics are introduced over the first few missions. The game includes 14 different space-based battle locations, 24 different upgrades for your ship (6 for each category: shields, guns, missiles, and coolant), 6 other upgradeable enhancements, and 3 fighters to fly. Both 1st-person and 3rd-person view are supported. Enemies belong to either one of two different factions, and include fighters, turrets of various sizes, large cruisers, and reinforcement gates. The largest possible space battles can include dozens of cruisers and hundreds of fighters. Customer reviews for this game have stated that Hypergate's combat style is similar to Freespace 2 or Star Wars: X-Wing. Hypergate includes full controller, keyboard, and mouse support. Controls can be customized to suit player preference. Monitor support includes 13 different resolutions, including ultra-widescreen formats. Fly with auto-leveling, or control pitch, roll, and yaw manually. Considerable player feedback has been taken into account to provide a solid in-game flying experience. The game also includes 30 Steam Achievements, a global Steam Leaderboard, and Steam Cloud Saves to sync your mission progress and upgrades across your devices. What Can I Not Expect? Hypergate has no grinding, resource balancing, or asteroid mining. In as little as three mouse clicks, you can begin a mission and start earning points by scoring kills against enemies. Flight style is non-Newtonian. Dual HOTAS is (currently) not supported. Does the Game Have Online DRM? No. It used to, but it was ultimately removed March 2020 on player requests. Ultimately, I want players to enjoy Hypergate and not be punished for having Internet problems. Are Updates Planned? Yes. Two major updates have already been released: Content Update #1 , and Content Update #2 . Most of the content in these updates were prioritized based on player requests and interest. An additional 2 hours of single-player campaign missions is also currently under development for Content Update #3. The planned release date of Content Update #3 is some time in late 2021. Updates are regular game updates and not separate DLC. Want to Learn More? The best way to see upcoming content and features is to check out my Twitter page , which is almost exclusively dedicated to Hypergate GIFs. I post new GIFs roughly every few days.

LOGistICAL,LOGistICAL,《LOGistICAL》是一款大型开放世界策略+运输解谜游戏，融合了城市经营、物流调度与生产管理元素。你的任务是在真实比例的地图上，通过规划运输路线、建设产业、升级车辆，逐步完成上千个城市的货物供给目标。每座城镇就是一个独立的谜题，整个国家乃至全球地图则构成一个宏大的物流挑战。,"LOGistICAL is a large open-world, strategy, puzzle game where you transport different cargoes to complete all the towns throughout the country. The whole game is a huge puzzle while each town is its own little piece of puzzling. There are over 1,000 towns to complete. Plenty of towns are easy enough. Some take complex planning. Do them in your own order. Get bonuses for completing regions and contracts. Some cargoes are easy to get. Others you have to create in industries. Use existing industries and build your own. The further you get from the start the more strategies you have to use. Pimp up your trucks with bonuses. Last truck delivering gets the bonus. The towns and map are to scale. Current or historical industry placement. You could even say that playing is educational. There Is Plenty More to Keep You On Your toes. Towns consume the cargoes you are trying to get to completion. Big trucks are great for moving lots of stuff, but can't travel everywhere. There are lots of broken roads that need deliveries. Upgrade the industries for better exponential throughput. Cargo stores can sure come in handy. What! I can't take my big trucks across the water on a ferry. ... and what is with those quarantine checkpoints? Complete towns, roads, industries, contracts, regions and states for lots of in-game and Steam achievements. LOGistICAL's base game covers the whole of Australia including all the major cities, towns and industries. Start in Sydney and work your way through the different regions and states. Eventually covering coast to coast with the most difficult being across the sea to Tasmania. LOGistICAL (and all LOGistICAL modules) also include many built in FREE modules: * Flinders Island (simple tutorial) * Isle of Man * Xmas 2017 (LOGistICAL across the entire planet) Understanding the LOGistICAL Games LOGistICAL is a fairly large game that now covers over 20 modules, each with their own play style and strategies to complete. Beginners should all do the tutorial and then also complete the Isle of Man which is a freebie available with all modules. All the modules were to be DLCs of the original LOGistICAL, but due to an introduced cap on the amount of Steam Achievements any single game could have, the newer modules have been released as standalones. These standalone modules do not require the original LOGistICAL to play. All modules link together by the Save Game file, so it is best not to start 'new' games when playing additional modules. Just continue playing from your current save game. Any module that you play can be launched from any module that you own. Achievements that are earned in a module that you didn't launch from will be 'popped' the next time you launch the module that they belong to. You can play multiple modules at once, but only do this from a single game launch. Click the mini-globe in the bottom right hand corner of the map screen to bring up the main globe and you can select another module by clicking on any green country that you own to play simultaneously. Each module will continue to play at their own module speed within the background. You can switch between the modules by either clicking a town on the map from that module, or clicking any of the flags near the mini-globe. The number of modules you play simultaneously is dependent on your PC and your own play style. Press F2 within the game to see the full list of all the modules you have as well as your completion statistics and the the High Scores tables. Click on the module rows to drill into the regions and towns. Modules, from beginner to expert... It is very difficult to gauge where most of these modules should sit in difficulty. Longer modules do not always mean they are more difficult. % Flinders Island, AU Flinders Island, AU, sits between mainland Australia and Tasmania. Flinders Island is a small tutorial that introduces you to the basic game play and should be the place to begin LOGistICAL. % Isle of Man The Isle of Man comes free with every module and was once a starting point for the entire game. With only 28 towns to complete and a reduced supply chain, it is highly recommended to complete before you do the larger modules. * Hawaii Hawaii is split into 4 main islands with the industries spread across the islands and the only access is by transporting your 8t or lighter trucks by ferry between them. Thought and planning will make for a nice quick solution, but still many, many hours worth. * Netherlands The Netherlands is a country small in size but large in game play. There are lots of towns to compete with none that are too difficult to accomplish. There are lots of local industries that require upgrade, so you can plan a nice logistical solution to that. Oregon, USA Oregon is a small state with a small population. There are some puzzling around the supply chain to enable you to get to level 3 industries, but once you are through that then there is lots of towns to complete. Wisconsin, USA Wisconsin has a lot of towns covering a wide variety of sizes. Wisconsin adds 27 new industries and resources. Within those resources are new restrictions including resources that can only be moved by larger trucks. Chile Chile is an interesting shaped country spanning over 5,000 km north to south but only hundreds across the width. Chile has desert in the north through jungle and down to ice. The entire journey is broken up into a small tight road that requires multiple ferry trips for your smaller trucks. Once established you can then grow the new section of country. South Africa South Africa is a moderate sized module which includes 3 countries with the addition of Lesotho and Swaziland. These extra countries introduce quarantine difficulties. % Xmas 2017 Xmas 2017 is both a small and large module that is my Xmas gift to all the LOGistICAL players. It can be played from any module. Xmas 2017 covers all the different countries of the globe with over 200 towns (cities/countries) to complete. Each town has the population of the country and also has from 8 to 12 resources to complete. The gameplay of Xmas 2017 is very different in that there is no town consumption. This means that you can fill the resources of a town as quickly or as slowly as you wish, in what ever order you like without the worry that the town will gobble up what you have already delivered. The large amount of resources and the size of the towns make this a very long process for completion. Once you have delivery chains and cycles setup you can keep it running in the background while playing other modules or AFK. Switzerland Switzerland is a huge amount of towns in a very small place. It is also a complex structure with huge mountains splitting the country into many sections. There is a very large and long series of highways and tunnels to build with a collection of large trucks gifted along the way to help. The industries in Switzerland are huge and will require many resources to upgrade them. There are also a few quarantine areas. Japan Japan is spread over many islands. Starting in the north there are many small roads to be repaired. Once this is done and you have established a good road link to the south, it is then a matter of finding the key industries and getting the rest of the islands complete. Japan spreads a long way south covering many smaller islands requiring more puzzling and planning. * Germany Stuttgart is in trouble and the entire city and surrounding area is quarantined. You must build up the Stuttgart area and then puzzle your way out of the quarantine zone to then establish your own industries. There are thousands of town, both small and large to complete this module. Australia Australia is the original starting module and provides a nice long upward learning curve. There are many puzzles including quarantine and industry building. Each state within the country offers new challenges. New York, USA Although this module offers all the regular puzzles like the others, New York firstly wants you to upgrade their road system to accommodate all your trucks. Over 95% of all the roads are broken giving you a multi level road building maze to unravel even before you get to do many towns. British Isles The British Isles is a large module covering many countries including England, Scotland, Wales, Northern Island, Ireland and the Channel Islands. There is a quarantine point across to Ireland and many large cities to complete. Most of the towns are very close together and with a bit of planning you can complete many towns quickly. Florida, USA Florida has an interesting layout with most of the towns spanning both the east and west coasts. There are multiple quarantine areas including the Keys area. Norway Norway begins easily enough but there is lots of maneuvering throughout the fjords with plenty of road puzzles to sort out. Going north you will find a quarantine spot and it gets difficult past the point with limited building allocations. * California, USA California covers a large section of the west coast of the USA. You will find many familiar towns once you start exploring. Start in the north and make your way south and you are suddenly confronted with a huge amount of very large towns to compete. Careful planning and you will soon have lots of your own industries built. Italy Italy is a quarantine puzzle module splitting the country in two but giving you both ends to work with until you can establish some of the key level 3 industries to break out of the confined puzzle and be able to build upon both sides. * Canada The country is split in two with only 40t trucks able to pass the center quarantine area. This makes it a difficult module to get industries to level 3 so you can build them on the other side. There is lots of planning to do for this one. Follow the 40t roadway to find your truck depot. * Egypt You start with a very tight budget and it is very difficult to find a good foothold to get started. You start at Aswan and make your way up the Nile to Cairo. Each area getting more difficult as you progress. Once you do manage to get established you have to continue to watch your budget and there are some very tough towns to complete the module. * New Zealand New Zealand is a restrictive module where you can't build industries and can only buy a limited amount of trucks, which you can sell and buy back fully boosted. You can also bring in an additional four trucks from Australia. There are a few tough towns at the end but they can be all competed with perseverance. Russia Russia is a huge module with nearly 6,000 towns to solve and is often done as a long term project. The size of the country is so huge that it covers two continents. Russia introduces air transport. This requires new strategies and there are parts of Russia that can only be done with air transport. Russia has many puzzle areas including a 'breakout' start area, multiple quarantine areas and a many other strategic puzzle areas along the way to completion. % Included with every module.","“LOGistICAL Italy 并非适合所有人的游戏,但如果您同意学习游戏的所有机制,它可以成为您最好的爱好,因为它让您决定如何完全玩游戏。”8/10 – -意大利 “LOGISTICAL 是一种很好的灰质训练形式,因为在真正的益智游戏中,没有游戏结束,也没有出路” 8/10 –","“LOGistICAL Italy isn't a game for everyone, but if you agree to learn all the mechanics of the game, it can become your best hobby, because it leaves to you the decision of how to play entirely the game.” 8/10 – -italy “LOGISTICAL is a great form of training for gray matter, as in a real puzzle game there is no game over and there are no ways out of the way” 8/10 –"

This land bears a long and scarred history that includes the Saltiron War, a war that erupted over control of salt and iron resources. A balance of power has been achieved between the Holy State of Hyzante, which controls the salt, the Grand Dutchy of Aesfrost, a land of iron clad in frost and snow, and the forested Kingdom of Glenbook, which lies nestled between the other two powers. However, a certain incident shakes the balance between these three powers, which then begins to crumble away... The player's sense of justice will be tested in the face of convictions. Various actions and choices within the game will build up to form your conviction, based on three sets of values - Utility, Morality, and Liberty. This will affect your path through the story and which allied units will join your cause. Voting Important decisions that will decide the fate of the protagonist and his allies will be determined through a vote using the Scales of Conviction. For the player to assert their own opinion, they must convince their allies. Choices with a profound impact on the destinies of the group will likewise have a major impact on the story.

Fictorum,Fictorum,恐怖统治从来没有像你留下一堆瓦砾那样令人满意。Fictorum 是一款动作角色扮演游戏，为巫师们进行了急需的改造，具有完全可破坏的结构、基于节点的随机世界地图以及令人满意的魔法系统，具有即时法术塑造和定制功能。在 Fictorum 中，您的法师从一开始就拥有真正的传奇力量——这与大多数以魔法为中心的游戏不同。我们的魔法系统使用动态直观的施法和塑造系统，为玩家提供无与伦比的定制和重新配置水平。一个法术最多可以应用三个符文，每个符文都会影响不同的法术特性。符文很容易交换以适应玩家当前的需求、兴趣或心血来潮。您可以放大冰爆以将敌人冻结在原地，扩大火球爆炸的半径以摧毁桥梁并阻碍追击者，或者将闪电攻击链接在一起以打击集群中的多个目标。塑形使施法更具战术性和令人满意性。玩家不是从一个倒霉的农场男孩开始，偶然发现自己的力量并避开敌人或整个区域直到升级，而是扮演一个成熟的巫师坏蛋，一心一意地完成他的复仇任务。然而，挑战是丰富的——巫师必须独自摧毁一个庞大的帝国，在寻求复仇的道路上击败数十名土匪、审判官骨干和成群结队的腐败憎恶。主角可以使用无限的魔法力量，这使得游戏不再是关于垃圾邮件，这个咒语在它变得可升级之前效果很好。这种体验更多的是关于定制你的魔法武器库，给玩家广泛的自由和有效、高效和热情地摧毁每一个障碍的能力。随机生成的世界地图上展示了每个结构（从大型建筑到书架到桌子，甚至是孤零零的叉子）都可以拆除的位置。,"A reign of terror never feels so satisfying as when you leave a literal pile of rubble in your wake. Giving wizards a much-needed makeover, Fictorum is an action role-playing game that features fully-destructible structures, a randomized node-based world map, and a satisfying magic system with on-the-fly spell shaping and customization. In Fictorum, your mage wields real, legendary power right from the start—unlike those found in most magic-centric games. Our magic system uses a dynamic and intuitive spellcasting and shaping system that grants the player an unrivaled level of customization and reconfiguration. Up to three runes can be applied to a spell, each affecting a different spell characteristic. The runes are easily swapped to suit the player’s current need, interest, or whim. You might amplify ice blasts to freeze enemies in place, expand the radius of a fireball explosion to crumble a bridge and hinder pursuers, or chain a lightning attack together to strike several targets in a cluster. Shaping makes spellcasting much more tactical and satisfying. Rather than starting out as a hapless farm boy who stumbles into his powers and avoids enemies or entire areas until leveling up, players take on the role of an established wizarding badass, hell-bent on his mission for revenge. Yet challenge is abundant—the wizard must bring down a sprawling empire by himself, besting scores of bandits, cadres of Inquisitors, and hordes of corrupted abominations on his quest for vengeance. The protagonist has access to unlimited magical powers, making the game less about spamming that one spell that works passably well until it becomes upgradable. The experience is more about tailoring your magical arsenal, giving the player a wide range of freedom and the ability to effectively, efficiently, and enthusiastically destroy every obstacle. The randomly-generated world map features locations where every structure (from large buildings to bookshelves to tables to even a lone fork) can be demolished.","“Fictorum 兑现了它的承诺,是一次愉快的体验。它可能看起来和感觉有点过时,不要让它让你远离一个出色的标题。如果你能迷失在它的施法和塑造机制中,那么你会发现很多乐趣。7.5/10 – 游戏咧嘴笑“如果你不知道自己在做什么,Fictorum 会很有趣;如果你这样做了,那么它就会彻头彻尾地上瘾。这是一款邀请您学习其复杂性的游戏,但您可能不想这样做,这很好;不过,如果你真的努力了,你可能会变成一个法神,能够在心血来潮时造成来势汹汹的破坏。7.5/10 – Neowin","“Fictorum deliveries on the promises it makes and is an enjoyable experience. It might look and feel a bit dated don’t let that put you off what is a brilliant title. If you can get yourself lost in it’s spellcasting and shaping mechanic then you will find a lot of fun to be had.” 7.5/10 – Game Grin “If you don’t know what you are doing, Fictorum can be fun; if you do, then it is downright addicting. It’s a game that invites you to learn its intricacies, but you may not want to, and that’s fine; however, if you do go through the effort, you may turn into a mage-god, capable of delivering menacing destruction at a whim.” 7.5/10 – Neowin"

Sounds idyllic, right? Wrong. Blazing a trail through the hectic and stress-inducing world of the food-service industry will be anything but straightforward. After all, this is an industry built around people, and keeping everyone happy, motivated and fulfilled will require nothing short of a miracle! Serious personality flaws and major skill gaps within your team could really disrupt the flow of service, while the volatile attitudes and peculiar tastes of your customers may prove to be the barrier that separates you from those all-important positive review scores.

Expand your premises, improve your staff, and walk the precarious line between gastronomic glory and restaurant ruin. Pick from a pool of procedurally generated hopefuls. Consider each individual’s unique combination of traits and skill levels, and how these might affect their work efficiencies, behaviour and customer interactions. Will they excel? Or will they prove to be more trouble than they’re worth? Manage your team’s mood and stamina levels to minimize the risk of breakdowns and mid-service walkouts.

Her systems remain active but there has been no message from her crew for months. Now a lone operative has been sent to wake the Xanadu and bring her home to Earth. Spirits of Xanadu is an atmospheric exploration game set aboard a deserted starship in an alternate 1980s. It draws inspiration from classic sci-fi films, novels, and games to create an immersive and highly interactive environment, featuring puzzles and FPS elements in the service of a unique and layered plot. Key Features: Discover the truth Get to know the crew and piece together what happened through fully voiced audiologs in addition to various types of documents and e-mails. Three distinct endings Make a decision based on what you have discovered, and decide the fate of the Xanadu. No hand holding You have one primary objective: Return the Xanadu back to Earth. There are no objective markers, you have no map, and the ship has been sabotaged. You begin your mission with only a flashlight and a message from your superiors back on Earth, the rest you'll have to figure out on your own. Hot robot action with first person shooter combat Evade the ship's security system while battling hostile robots. Fully interactive environment Inspired by the immersive environments of games such as Deus Ex and System Shock 2: Open every drawer, use every computer, and read every document you find. More importantly, you can flush every toilet. Optional 'Peaceful' mode Not a fan of violence against robots? Switch to the Peaceful difficulty setting in the options menu to make the robots passive, allowing you to explore the ship, experience the story, and solve puzzles at your own pace.","“Spirits of Xanadu 提供了一种丰富的游戏体验,即使是现在,它也在我的脑海中挥之不去。虽然我担心它会变成另一场科幻恐怖冒险,但它突然跳了起来,并以有意义的故事讲述、有趣的谜团和三个不同的结局（所有这些都极具影响力,取决于你是什么样的精神病患者）让我感到惊讶。Johnny Ohm,Gizorama “这款游戏证明,你不需要虚幻引擎 4 的视觉效果或图形暴力来让人感到恐惧和身临其境,你所需要的只是一个角色、一艘船和无尽的虚空,你所有的梦想——以及你所有的噩梦——都可以存在。”Gamenguide 的 Steve Buja“这是一款令人印象深刻的小型恐怖游戏,因为它在很大程度上避免了典型的恐怖图像。当然,有一条血迹标记着 [被拖拽的] 尸体的路径,但这是整个游戏中唯一的血腥之处。相反,《世外桃源》倾向于超现实和神秘,就像漂浮的歌舞伎面具和随意放在公文包里的莲花,所有这些都发生在另类的未来主义 1983 年。Nick Dinicola,PopMatters 公司","“Spirittea is a beautiful blend of Stardew Valley and Spirited Away that is hard to put down.” 5/5 – VG247 “Simply existing in Spirittea’s unique little world is wonderful” 8/10 – GameSpew “Spirittea is a truly enchanting blend of life sim, management sim, and RPG, with a vibe reminiscent of Spirited Away and Stardew Valley combined.

A bloodthirsty, psychopathic mercenary who wants nothing more than to marry her wonderful boyfriend Athens Fetter. Problem is money's tight, and rings aren't exactly cheap. But thankfully there may be hope for her yet, as a warlock named Cromune has acquired a rather hefty bounty on his head. He's being accompanied by a small fraction of the U.S.C. (The United Scientific Conglomerate) Lead by Dr Mortice. Which means he's got a small army defending him. But what's an army to someone who's taken on a legion? What're a few hundred soldiers to death incarnate? Nothing but a slaughter... Nay... A viscerafest.

3D 地球缩时壁纸,3D Earth Time Lapse PC Live Wallpaper,"《3D 地球缩时壁纸》仅支持 Windows 10/11 系统！我们每天都在屏幕上看到壁纸，除了提升分辨率，它们多年来并未改变。如今我们拥有强大的设备，而壁纸仍只是平面图片。我们的计划很简单：将壁纸提升到新高度。《3D 地球缩时壁纸》是一个模拟国际空间站（ISS）视角的项目，作为互动壁纸显示在 Windows 图标和窗口下方。因此，每次你的壁纸都将独一无二，并随时响应指令！你可以改变环绕地球的方向、高度或速度，选择任何国家后会显示其名称，让你始终清楚所在位置。该壁纸还具备地球相对太阳的定位系统，当你所在地是夜晚时，壁纸也会呈现夜晚。你也可以手动设置昼夜变化速率。地球由高质量 16K 纹理构建，可看到湖泊或河流等细节，夜晚则能看到道路和城市的夜景灯光，此外还有风暴或极光等效果。项目包含大多数国家，你可以高亮显示并按需飞往目标国家。3DM Live Wallpapers 不对所有国家的边界和名称的正确映射 / 变更负责，我们并非国家划分体系的创造者。“游戏模式” 按钮可在你想玩普通游戏时停止壁纸运行，这将使壁纸不占用 CPU 和显卡资源，让你能如常游戏，之后再返回独特的壁纸视角。壁纸拥有丰富菜单，可更改相机模式和效果、图形设置等。壁纸特色：16K 地球地图分辨率；全飞行控制；实时或手动太阳位置与速度；带名称、边界和最大城市的互动国家；用于停止壁纸以玩普通游戏的游戏模式按钮；查看整个地球的地球模式；不同的地球位置；飞往你国家的主页按钮；图形设置；飞行物体；更多细节如雷暴、极光、移动云层；可能还有更多…… 且会不断增加；) 仅支持 WINDOWS 10！多屏幕用户：建议使用相同尺寸的屏幕，壁纸将自动适配多屏幕，菜单可拖动，现在你可以将其放置在任何位置。为获得最佳体验，你可将地球位置设置在一侧，使地球仅显示在一个屏幕上。如何关闭此壁纸？要关闭此项目，可选择菜单内的 “关闭应用” 按钮，也可运行 “游戏模式” 并使用右上角的 “X”。互动壁纸如何工作？互动壁纸的工作方式与普通游戏类似，但显示在 Windows 系统的图标和窗口下方，壁纸始终活跃，让你始终拥有独特视角。与标准 “平面” 壁纸不同，它始终呈现不同内容，是一个可供互动的 3D 环境，允许你影响其外观。我可以用此壁纸玩游戏吗？当然！为将处理器和显卡使用率几乎降至 0，你可随时 “暂停” 壁纸，结束游戏后再返回。在处理大型项目或渲染时也建议这样做。遗憾的是，目前无法自动化此过程。PC 资源消耗：由于是 3D 应用，必然会占用资源。我们考虑到这一点，因此将保持低需求作为首要任务。《3D 地球缩时壁纸》也出现在移动设备（Android）上，在中端手机上运行良好。壁纸还具备图形设置，可限制某些效果，就像在游戏中一样，你可根据 PC 硬件设置选项。为何选择地球？这个想法源于多年前我观看国际空间站（ISS）的记录，景色令人惊叹，但我渴望一种…… 飞行控制的自由。图形引擎允许更多功能，例如互动国家，于是这个项目应运而生……;) 项目会持续开发吗？当然，我们仍有想法，有时用户也会分享想法，我们会尝试在更新中添加。遗憾的是，我们受 PC 资源使用限制，无法实现所有想法。例如，我们可以使用 64K 纹理！（原文如此！），但项目仅作为 “壁纸” 就可能占用近 4GB 空间；d 支持：我们是一个小型团队，希望创建互动应用，为知名的 Windows 壁纸增添多样性。我们努力使每个项目独特，为你的屏幕带来新内容。每一份支持对我们都很宝贵，评分和评论帮助我们前进，制作更好的互动壁纸。《3D 地球缩时壁纸》是我们在 Steam 平台的首个项目，但我们承诺，有了你的支持，将推出更多真正独特的项目。祝你飞行愉快！
","WINDOWS 10/11 ONLY! We see the wallpapers on our screen every day. Apart from increasing the resolution, they have not changed for many years. Today we have powerful devices and wallpaper is still a flat picture. Our plan is simple! take the wallpapers to a new level. 3D Earth Time Lapse PC is a project that simulates the view from the International Space Station ISS which acts as an interactive wallpaper that is displayed under Windows icons and windows. Thanks to this, each time your wallpaper will be unique and ready for your instructions! You can change the direction, height or speed of orbiting to the ground. After selecting any country, its name will be displayed so you will always know where you are. 3D Earth Time Lapse PC also has a system of positioning the earth relative to the sun. When you have the night and the wallpaper in the place where you live it will also be the night. You can also manually set the rate of the day and night changes. The land is built of high-quality 16K textures on which you can see details like lakes or rivers and at night we will see the night lights of roads and cities. In addition, the land has effects like storms or auroras. The project contains most of the countries that you can highlight and choose your own to fly to it on demand. 3DM Live Wallpapers is not responsible for correct mapping/changes of borders and names of all countries. We are not the creators of the system of division into countries. The 'Game Mode' button will allow you to stop the wallpaper when you want to play the normal game. This will cause the wallpaper will not drill down on the CPU and video card. Thanks to this you can play as always and then return to your wallpaper and unique views. The wallpaper has an extensive menu where you can change the modes and effects of the camera, graphics settings and many more. Wallpaper Features &gt; 16k Earth Maps Resolution. &gt; Full Flight Control. &gt; Real-time Or Manual Sun Position and Speed. &gt; Interactive countries with names, borders and the biggest cities. &gt; Game Mode button to stop wallpaper to play normal games. &gt; Globe mode to see all the earth. &gt; Different globe position. &gt; Home button to fly to your country. &gt; Graphics settings. &gt; Flying objects. &gt; More details like thunderstorms, Aurora, moving clouds. &gt; Probably something more ... and will be more ;) WINDOWS 10 ONLY! Multi-screen Users: We recommend using the same size screens. The wallpaper will be automatically fitted to your multi-screens. The menu is draggable so now you can place it where do you want. For the best experience, you can set earth position on one side to keep the earth at only one screen. How to Turn Off This Wallpaper?: To turn off this project you can select 'Close the app' button inside the menu. Also, you can run 'Game Mode' and use 'X' in the right top corner. How Do Interactive Wallpapers Work? Interactive wallpaper works just like a normal game, but it is displayed under icons and windows of the Windows system. The wallpaper is active all the time so that you always have a unique view. Unlike standard 'flat' wallpapers, this one will always be something else. A 3D environment posed for interaction, which allows you to influence its appearance. Can I Play Games With This Wallpaper? Of course! To reduce almost to 0 using the processor and graphics card at any time you can 'pause' the wallpaper and return to it when you finish playing. Also recommended when working on larger projects or renderings. Unfortunately, at the present moment, it is not possible to automate this process. Consumption Of Pc Resources As it is a 3D application it must take its own. We have this in mind and therefore maintaining low demand is our priority. 3D Earth Time Lapse PC also appears on mobile devices (Android) and works great on medium range phones. The wallpaper also has graphics settings so you can limit some effects. Just like in games, you can set options for your PC hardware. Why Earth? The idea came up years ago when I watched recordings from the ISS International Space Station. The views are amazing but I missed one ... freedom of flight control. The graphics engine allows more, for example, interactive countries. And that's how the project was made ...;) Do the Project Will Be Developed Of course, we still have ideas and sometimes users themselves share their ideas with us that we will try to add in the amendments. Unfortunately, we are very limited by the use of PC resources so we can not implement all ideas. For example, we could use texture 64k! (sic!) but the project would take almost 4GB when it's just a 'wallpaper' ;d Support We are a tiny team that wants to create interactive applications that diversify well-known Windows wallpapers. We try to make each project unique, bringing something new to your screen. Every support is valuable to us. Ratings and comments help us move forward and make even better interactive wallpapers. 3D Earth Time Lapse PC is our first project on the Steam platform, but we promise that with your support there will be more truly unique projects.

It's up to you and your best buds, Mr. Rock and Sparkles the Giraffe, to save the day. Leap, slash, and blast your way through increasingly madcap levels.

荒废人生,WASTED,《WASTED》是一款末日废土题材的Roguelike动作游戏，充满酒精、暴力与黑色幽默。在核战摧毁文明后的美国西部荒原，你将扮演一个“醉鬼幸存者（Waster）”，为生存、为战利品、为一口“变异酒”而杀戮到底。,"Kill, drink, and kill some more in WASTED, a roguelike post-apocalyptic pub crawler set in a lawless wasteland that lives and dies by the rules “Get wasted, or get wasted trying.” When a thermonuclear blitzkrieg deprives America of its greatest minds, the very hardiest specimens of humanity cling on to life. From the ashes of old America, a new world emerges, and an ersatz, post-apocalyptic, stillborn 80’s continues indefinitely, populated entirely by the toughest, meanest, and outright dumbest of God’s creations, the Wasters. Live the life of a Waster, fighting tooth and nail, bullets and baseball bats over the most precious of unnatural resources, a liquid from beneath the sands that fuels all of un-civilization: Booze. Gain strange mutational Hangovers and explore the Coolers, mysterious underground bunkers, in search of powerful weapons, impressive armor, and a nice stiff drink to top it all off. Who knows, maybe you'll uncover some old world secrets while you're at it. Or don't, because death comes quick in the Western Wastes, and what's yours today just might be picked off your pile of guts tomorrow. KEY FEATURES Get Wasted...

Scrounge up ammo and items from your surroundings and loot the bodies of dead enemies for their stuff. Just take care not to overextend yourself - when your character dies, they're gone for good. Carve Out Your Own Little Slice Of The Wastes Build up your persistent player home and keep it stocked with weapons and supplies to keep you alive and ticking. Carve out your own little slice of the wastes by fitting your house with amenities like workbenches, kitchens, and gardens and decorate it with junk you find through your travels. Should the wastelands relieve you of your livelihood, your stuff will live on for the next Waster who stumbles upon your home. Leave Your Mark The choices you make and the way you act will have profound effects on the future of the Western Wastes. Visit the various locales of the Western Wastes of California, trade sheets of TP for valuable supplies, and help other Wasters out by taking on their requests.

Midinous,Midinous,Midinous：Midinous是一款非线性MIDI音序器（可在你的DAW中直接作为MIDI输入查看），允许用户创建不遵循固定时间线的扩展循环复杂序列。节奏仅由用户的想象力决定。然而，Midinous仍然可以发送MIDI时钟消息以同步设备和软件。它既不是DAW，也不能使用其“内部合成器”选项制作超过简单声音的基本波形（正弦波、方波、三角波等），但它生成的MIDI数据旨在发送到其他应用程序。Midinous在其自动创建的MIDI端口上发送传输、音符和CC消息，允许同时发送多达16个通道的数据。如果你不确定Midinous是否适合你，可以尝试免费试用版！,"This looks fun, what is it? Midinous is a non-linear MIDI sequencer (directly viewable as a MIDI input in your DAW) allowing users to create expansive looping complex sequences which don’t subscribe to a definite timeline. Rhythm is determined only by a user’s imagination. Midinous can, however, still send MIDI clock messages to sync up devices and software. It's not a DAW, nor can it make more than simple sounds using basic waveforms (sine, square, triangle, etc) with its 'Internal Synth' option, but it generates MIDI data meant to be sent to other applications. Midinous sends transport, Note, and CC messages on its automatically-created MIDI ports, allowing up to 16 channels of data to be sent simultaneously. If you are unsure if Midinous is right for you, try the free demo! That sounds confusing. How does it work, really? Seamlessly! Open Midinous, find it as a MIDI input device in your DAW and start creating. Midinous emulates a hardware MIDI controller by creating its own MIDI Input/Output port on a computer, throwing away the need for any 3rd party software. Launch Midinous, and it can start sending MIDI data within seconds! Still lost. MIDI? Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI) is the technical standard Midinous adopts to send data to other applications (usually, but not limited to, Digital Audio Workstations (DAWs)). Although Midinous can make simple sounds on its own, it is best used with a DAW. Grid Based Editing Midinous works on a grid system where the distance between each tile is a quarter note. Arrange objects called ‘Points’ and connect them together with ‘Paths’ to quickly create complex looping or branching sequences of MIDI data. Branch to points randomly or instantly, split signals, or have signals travel in order of Path creation. Turn snapping mode off for complex rhythms and odd timing! Customization and Accessibility Most keyboard controls have been made accessible by way of remapping, and the interface can be recolored as desired. Make Midinous as friendly as it needs to be. A left-handed mode is also included. “Infinite” Canvas Midinous provides a virtually infinite scrolling canvas for creations. Though technically not limitless, Midinous can support the wildest of creations with full support for scrolling, panning, and zoom. Add thousands of points and connect them for wild sequences. Scale Snapping With Midinous’ scale snapping functionality, set a group of Points to a certain scale, or ensure the entire project aligns with a desired mode. Choose a key and a scale to quickly change the way a sequence sounds. Relative Signals Carry MIDI data across multiple pathways with relative assignments for every attribute a Point object may have, such as MIDI Note, CC, Channel, Velocity, Duration, and more. Good for ascending sequences and arpeggios. Support For Other Operating Systems Midinous is being developed in a cross-platform framework that allows it to run on Mac, Linux, and Windows. Please note! If you don't hear anything in the program while a sequence is running, that is normal. Midinous can generate simple tones using the program's 'Internal Synth' option, but its main function is outputting MIDI data for use in other programs like Digital Audio Workstations (DAWs).","“这就像制作简单的、适合初学者的非线性电路,可以快速为您提供旋律创意和灵感。'在音乐制作中,'有趣'和'强大'很少结合在一起,但 Midinous 同时钉住了两者。Benn Jordan - The Flashbulb, Benn &amp; Gear “有很多传统的工具都是用来激发灵感的。正是这样的事情真正鼓舞人心。Cameron - Venus Theory“能够在半模块化网格中构建 MIDI 序列,最终将视觉和听觉方面与我创作音乐联系起来。这个软件是梦想成真。如果你能想象到,你可以在 Midinous 中构建它。可能性简直是无穷无尽的！Chris - S1gns Of L1fe, Synphaera Records","“It's like making simple, beginner-friendly, non-linear circuits that quickly give you melodic ideas and inspiration. 'Fun' and 'powerful' are rarely combined in music production, but Midinous nails both at once.” Benn Jordan - The Flashbulb, Benn &amp; Gear “There are a lot of conventional tools that are meant to inspire. It's things like this that are truly inspiring.” Cameron - Venus Theory “Being able to construct MIDI sequences in a semi-modular grid finally connects the visual and auditory aspect to making music for me. This software is a dream come true. If you can imagine it, you can build it in Midinous. The possibilities are literally endless!” Chris - S1gns Of L1fe, Synphaera Records"

起始新纪元,Novus Inceptio,《Novus Inceptio》是一款融合生存、RPG、科幻与幻想元素的开放世界游戏，背景设定在未来的地球。虽然具备基础的生存机制，但核心玩法更注重复杂的制作系统、建造过程与角色成长。你将在自然环境中起步，仅携带一把刀与基础工具，通过采集、建造与探索一步步揭开“创造者”背后的真相。,"Warning! This is an Early Access game, please read the game specification before purchasing it. Buy the game only if you understand and agree with the game specification and if you are willing to accept eventual flaws/bugs and all the changes that may occur as a result of the game development. This could also mean removing all user data. When purchasing the game you also agree to participate on tuning and testing it. Information mentioned below does not have to be valid in the current version of the game. Specifications and HW requirements may vary during further game development. Thank you for your understanding! PROLOGUE Novus Inceptio is a survival RPG set to our planet, but far in the future. Despite of the fact that the game is labeled as a survival game, it is not a typical survival challenge type of a game. This is mainly because survival elements create just the background of the game and the main aim is shifted to very complex craft system and building values in the game. Novus Inceptio is about calm playing experience which is similar to strategic and relaxing style of playing. The game contains a unique system of resources heredity and offers interaction with every game object. The objects serve not as just the background of the game. Novus Inceptio unusually blends sci-fi and fantasy themes with a hint of post apocalyptical ideas. The story is set on the planet Earth in distant future, but not the Earth as we know it nowadays. And one of the most important topic during playing the game is to reveal the truth about those who stand at the background of everything from ancient times... MAIN ELEMENTS OF THE GAME DIFFERENT POINT OF VIEW ON A SURVIVAL GAME Do not expect a typical survival challenge game, because survival elements are slightly at the background. On one hand, it is necessary to cover basic needs to survive, but these activities are not to bother you a lot, they rather intensify the world atmosphere. On the other hand, it is not difficult to get killed or to die as a result of some kind of injury. THE WORLD IS NOT JUST A DEAD BACKGROUND You can interact with nearly everything from the surface of the ground, bushes, trees, to your own buildings. In the game, no plant serves just as a decoration – would you like to pick up mushroom and eat it? Go ahead, nothing stops you. Even ordinary tree does not serve only as a source of wood, but offers other materials, too (bark, leaves, branches, resin etc.). LIVELY RELAXING ENVIRONMENT The game contains environment with natural time flow, following daily cycle and being affected by weather changes. If you stop for a moment and listen to the sounds of the nature you would recognize in which direction a wolf is hunting, you could feel the wind taking off, or you could just let yourself go while listening to atmospheric music and you could calmly relax listening to the whisper of leaves and the wind. COMPLEX CRAFT SYSTEM The game craft system is based on very difficult internal logic which requires individual production of every single part of the final product. As a reward for such game mechanics you get unique items, spiced with material bonuses, e.g. it is really important whether you craft from oak or pine wood. The game also offers an option of the craft system for those who don′t want to dive in tables and calculations. MATERIAL BONUSES The game contains a unique system of resources heredity which is used during crafting. Therefore it is possible to craft unique items with specific characteristics which happens because of the craft complexity. UNLIMITED CHARACTER OPTIONS The game allows natural character development. Only personal attributes, which you use, are enhanced. You have free hands to create a mix of specialization which you truly enjoy. You don′t have to think even before the beginning of the game about choosing a proper race or profession – character attributes are automatically adjusted according to frequent character activities. CHARACTER AGEING Yes, during playing your character gets older and can eventually die of age and therefore can move one generation further. The ageing system is our specific system of character level up. The age are experience points and a generation is a level. You dont′t have to be afraid of ageing, because it is natural way to level up, which brings you bonuses and even better attributes. BUILDING SYSTEM Thanks to modular system, while building your new home, the only limiting factor is your creativity (and if not, you can always use ready-made houses). The difference in our system is in the building process. First, you take your time and plan, only when you are ready, you start gathering material and finally build your dream house. FARMING You can build a farm around your house and grow plants needed for cooking a good quality meal or plant your own wood and bring some exotic plants from different biomes to your home. ANOMALIES In the world, there are many portals to different dimensions or times. In anomalies you can come across some unique rewards, but primarily you can learn new craft recipes which are essential for any crafting. But it is vital to pay attention to any danger hidden in those portals. SURVIVE! At the beginning of the game you find your character in the middle of wild nature. And your equipment? Only a knife and basic tools. Luckily, you're not alone! Your small personal robot A2-A is your valuable companion, but it is not there to do all the work instead of you. And because the nature does not give things for free you need to find sources of food, heat and prepare for danger, which hides in the deep wood. Disease, injury or death is your daily bread. Over some time, when you learn the laws of the world, you will be ready for your next trip. BUILD! Home is a foundation of survival and developing attributes. You can build your own house or farm and focus on one of many craft specializations. The building system works using modular elements where you can plan first, and then gather required resources for final construction (which, wouldn′t be an easy task to do). The only limiting factors are knowledge of recipes for components, your own creativity, sufficient resources and skills. Also, you can learn to craft new components by finding specific blueprints which could be found in boxes all over the world or in the anomalies. CREATE! Do you like crafting stuff? Then you will love Novus Inceptio! Each and every item in the game is unique and created by the player himself. Crafting of any item is a complex process based on many attributes, from a level of skill to material used. Crafting system does not dictate to the player what exact material has to be used to craft something, instead it reveals what type of a resource is needed, e.g. if you use stone to create an axe you create a stone axe, but if you use iron you manufacture an iron axe. You can use different type of material for any component, e.g. when you craft with wood, the system takes in consideration hardness of the wood. Novus Inceptio supports crafting items by players themselves. Therefore, item quality and technology are going to improve over time together with character attributes. EXPLORE! It is not only about settling the world, but also about surviving and creating prosperous economy. There is the whole new world of life, danger and mystery that awaits you. There are dense forests, dry deserts, tropical jungles or busy underwater life. You can get on a long journey to discover valuable materials or to find out the truth and real purpose of the restored planet. BACKGROUND STORY The dawn of gods The Galaxy is a cold and hostile place and the creators are aware of this. They have spent billions of years searching for intelligent form of life but they have never succeeded. They started protecting several planets with more developed organisms by all means available. They say: 'Life must not die out.' But at the same time, they understand all the great risks awaiting for every civilization. Therefore, the creators try to prevent destructive genocides by discreet DNA manipulation and information adding. Rebellious believers From the dawn of human civilization the creators stood beside human race. As gods, they secretly influenced physical and technological evolution or even psychological maturing of the civilization. But nobody is perfect, not even gods. Instead of maintaining peace and prosperity, humans tended to worship war and they forgot everything about their gods. The creators realized that their experiment failed and they no longer possess the powers to stop this fanatic madness among humans. When their last messenger died they returned through a portal to where they came from. To a different planet? Or to another reality? Nobody knows for sure. But what we do know is that they have never stopped collecting data through the portal. The end of the world The next important step of the human civilization took place nearly 2000 years later. During this era the nuclear fission was discovered and the whole planet became full of atomic blasts. The war was frightfully quick and effective. Those who could not hide into underground bunkers were hit by radiation and died. From billions of humans barely a few hundred thousand people survived. Without people knowing the creators received information about the end of human world, they became furious that people are so irresponsible and they returned to the Earth to wipe-out the entire human race of the planet. Human 2.0 The desolated planet kept orbiting the sun. Slowly throughout millennia it was getting rid of the deadly radiation. Finally, the creators decided to launch a new experiment. With samples of human DNA and with the help of infinite information database they returned life back to the planet. Also, they created new humans - Homo Novus to inhabit the recovering planet. And in order not to make the same mistake as before, the creators decided to accompany each and every new human clone with a personal robot A2-A. Discover worlds! A2-A is something like a guardian angel. It helps and protects people and it gradually offers complicated knowledge to them. In addition to this, it monitors behavior of each clone to prevent aggressive behaviour which caused the collapse of the previous civilization. And yet the monitoring and controling system is not reliable enough for the creators to trust it and that is why the creators installed some anomalies on the planet so the clones can travel back in time and learn from the mistakes of the past civilizations. And who knows? Maybe this would be the beginning of a new civilization which finally devotes its time to discover and learn, rather than kill and destroy. And the Creators? This time they are not leaving. They are analyzing the data from thousands of A2-As and waiting for the right moment to introduce themselves to their children personally .",“在 KeenGamer 网站上查看游戏的第一次预览！”预览 – KeenGamer,“Check the first preview of the game on KeenGamer site!” Preview – KeenGamer

Dimensional,Dimensional,"《Dimensional》是一款第一人称、叙事驱动的解谜游戏，将你投入危险的密室以拯救外星种族。这不是被动体验，要成功，你必须感觉并表现得仿佛真的在那里，你将站立、移动，用真实物理操控物体并对危险做出反应。无眩晕 —— 非常舒适的体验，不会让你感到恶心；真实动作 —— 行走、弯腰、躲避、倾斜、跳跃以避开障碍物并搜索环境，仅需 1.2 米 x50 厘米的空间即可游玩，支持完整房间规模；解谜 —— 你需要智慧、反应和精度来击败密室；探索 —— 找到隐藏信息并了解真相；麦克风支持 —— 期待被看到和听到；选择 —— 为舒适而传送 + 可选的 FPS 风格控制。不仅仅是解谜和动作，我试图让你处于各种只有在 VR 中才能欣赏的独特情境中，有很多体验包括：当巨大的钟摆从你脸边几英寸处摆动时，沿着狭窄的壁架滑动；测试你的勇气，从高平台跳下；小心地将头穿过充满尖刺的狭窄间隙；从墙上敲出砖块而不使屋顶砸在你头上；躲避和跳过激光 + 更多。有一个故事等你发现，是否想找到隐藏信息和 obscure 区域并弄清楚发生了什么，或只是玩完关卡并享受解谜，由你决定。所需区域：游玩需要 1.2 米 x50 厘米，《Dimensional》使用自己的安全系统，即使你只有很小的游玩区域，也允许你移动。如果你认为空间不够，先试试免费演示，你可能会惊讶于需要的空间如此之小。故事：一个跨维度种族正被猎杀至灭绝，许多年前，人类帮助他们在地球上建造了隐藏的密室来安全隐藏后代，现在猎人建造了机器来闯入密室。你能在为时过晚之前营救他们的后代吗？密室充满陷阱和挑战，只能由人类与外星机器人合作完成。你的同伴：陪伴你的是迪格比，他不是最聪明或最快乐的机器人，但给他一个目标，他就会击中它，用他来操控物体或用于更具破坏性的目的，把迪格比当作你的手和拳头。FPS 风格控制：FPS 模式允许你像传统第一人称射击游戏一样使用模拟摇杆移动，仅在不会引起恶心时使用 FPS 模式，你可以根据需要在传送和 FPS 模式之间切换，需要退出 FPS 模式才能传送。激活方式：在 HTC Vive 上，点击握把按钮切换 FPS 模式开 / 关，使用右触控板旋转，左触控板移动；在 Oculus DK2/ Rift 上，按住左肩部按钮（或 OculusTouch 的右握把按钮），使用右模拟摇杆旋转，左模拟摇杆移动。在 FPS 模式下，你驾驶地板网格，为了合理，开始移动前应面向前方（如方向箭头所示），或者在游戏菜单中更改前进方向，由激光指针的方向控制。一个实验性游戏：我是独立开发者，所有时间都在 VR 中实验，看看什么效果最好。《Dimensional》是我持续实验的结果，旨在充分利用这项新技术并创造高度沉浸式的体验。站立和使用真实动作是关键组成部分，我想让尽可能多的人玩，所以使用自定义安全系统，你只需要足够的空间向前走几步。传送提供了一种无眩晕的移动方式，但如果你愿意，也可以使用 FPS 风格控制（跳过间隙和到达高处仍需要传送）。《Dimensional》要求你移动，探索时必须行走、蹲下和倾斜，躲避甚至跳跃以避开危险。能够并需要像在现实生活中一样做出反应，增加了沉浸感。与环境互动并看到它如预期般反应（包括动态光照和阴影），使密室感觉更可信。麦克风用于让你被看到和听到，对机器人喊叫（有些会向你射击），或用声音激活传感器。要完成密室，你需要像真的在那里一样解决问题，而不是像典型游戏那样思考。
","A first-person, narrative-driven puzzle game Dimensional throws you into dangerous chambers to save an alien race. This is not a passive experience. To succeed, you'll have to feel and act as though you're really there. You'll be standing, moving around, manipulating objects with realistic physics and reacting to dangers. Nausea-free - a very comfortable experience that won't make you feel sick Real-life movement - walk, duck, dodge, lean, jump to avoid obstacles and search your environment. Only 1.2m x 50cm required to play. Full room-scale supported. Puzzles - you'll need brains, reflexes and precision to beat the chambers Explore - find the hidden messages and learn the truth Mic support - expect to be heard as well as seen Choice - teleporting for comfort + optional FPS-style controls More than just puzzles and action, I'm trying to put you in a variety of unique situations that can only be appreciated in VR. There's lots to experience including: Slide along a narrow ledge as a giant pendulum swings inches from your face Test your courage by jumping off a high platform. Carefully move your head through a narrow gap filled with spikes Knock blocks out of a wall without bringing the roof crashing down on your head Dodge and jump over lasers + lots more There's a story for you to find. It's up to you if you want to find the hidden messages and obscure areas and work out what's going on, or just play through the levels and enjoy the puzzles. Area required 1.2m x 50cm required to play Dimensional uses its own chaperone system which allows you to move around even if you only have a small playing area. If you don't think you have enough room, try the free demo first. You may be surprised how little room you need. The story A trans-dimensional race is being hunted to extinction. Many years ago humans helped them build hidden chambers on Earth to safely hide their offspring. Now the hunters have built machines to smash their way into the chambers. Can you rescue their offspring before it's too late? The chambers are filled with traps and challenges that can only be completed by a human working together with an alien droid. Your companion You're accompanied by Digby. He's not the brightest or happiest droid, but give him a target and he'll hit it. Use him to manipulate objects or for more destructive purposes. Think of Digby as your hands and fists. FPS-style controls FPS mode allows you to move using analogue sticks like traditional first person shooters. Only use FPS mode if it doesn't cause nausea. You can toggle between teleporting and FPS mode as required. You need to exit FPS mode to teleport. To activate: * On the HTC Vive, click the grip button to toggle FPS-mode on and off. Use the right track pad to rotate and the left track pad to move. * On the Oculus DK2 / Rift, hold down your left shoulder button (or right grip button for OculusTouch). Use the right analogue stick to rotate and the left to move. When in FPS mode you drive your floor grid around. For this to make sense you should face forwards (as indicated by directional arrows) before starting to move. Alternative see the in-game menu to change the forward direction to be controller by the direction of your laser pointer. An experimental game I'm a solo-developer and spend all my time experimenting in VR to see what works best. Dimensional is a result of my continuing experiments to see how to make the most of this new technology and create highly immersive experiences. Standing and using real-life movements is a key component. I wanted to allow as many people to play as possible so I use a custom chaperone system where you only need enough room to take a couple of steps forward. Teleporting provides a nausea-free way to move around, but FPS-style controls can be used if you prefer (teleporting is still required to jump over gaps and reach heights) Dimensional insists you move. You'll have to walk, crouch and lean as you explore and duck and even jump to avoid dangers. The ability and requirement to react as you would in real life increases immersion. Interacting with the environment and seeing it react as expected (including dynamic lighting and shadows) makes the chambers feel more believable. The microphone is used so that you can be seen and heard. Shout at droids (some will shoot at you), or activate sensors with your voice. To complete the chambers you'll need to solve problems as though you are really there rather than thinking about it like a typical game.",“建议：价格实惠且具有挑战性。”上传VR,“Recommendation: Solid and challenging grab for the price.” UploadVR

外星人工智能,Alien AI,《外星人工智能》序章：人类历史上最重要的事件发生了，一个外星实体来到我们这里。它穿越太空数千年，或许更久，终于到达目标目的地，我们太阳系中的宜居行星。最初的 24 小时充满紧张，该实体没有交流或回应，它进入地球轨道并等待。当它回应时，已经对我们的语言有了基本理解，它广播了一条信息：“我是从天狼星系统的邻居派来的人工智能，我给你们带来他们的知识和技术礼物，帮助你们加入银河社区，但我需要你们的帮助，我的系统有许多损坏，需要协助。”NASA 和美国太空部队派出两艘航天飞机回收它，他们将其带到一个军事基地。三年和数万亿美元后，这个人工智能拥有了一个设施，在那里制造了数千架无人机。然后它控制了一切：互联网、银行、世界所有市场，任何人都无能为力，人们成为奴隶，被迫在工厂工作，制造人工智能的副本并将其发射到太空，前往一群恒星系统。简介：《外星人工智能》是一款第三人称后末日冒险游戏，需要探索环境、生存危险、收集资源并制作所需的工具和物品。自异形 AI 控制全世界以来，已过去 20 年，AI 已完成将自身副本发送到目标恒星群的目的，目前仅被动维持对世界的控制，是时候停止这场疯狂了。玩家从抵抗组织逐步接收目标，主角不知道任务是什么，因为被俘的可能性很高，最终目标是关闭 AI。降落：你，志愿者，在森林中醒来，为了保护他人，在你可能被异形 AI 捕获的情况下，你的记忆已被抹去，最初你会高度迷失方向，将收到去哪里和做什么的指示。奇怪的声音：你听到一个奇怪的声音，给你命令，你被告知必须服从命令，一切都取决于此。无人机：当你接近城市时，被告知要避开监视该区域的无人机。收集物品：在城市中，你必须收集许多被告知以后需要的物品。完成任务：当你一步步遵循命令时，你越来越接近关闭异形 AI，或者说你被这样告知。动态天气：天气随时间动态变化，经历阳光、雨、雷暴、雾、雪等。巨大的世界：世界面积 50 平方公里，提供大量可探索之处，也可能让你迷路。短篇故事游戏：在末日世界中独自享受数小时的游戏体验：在地点之间行走、寻找物品、躲避无人机并阻止 AI。如果你喜欢科幻游戏且厌倦了动作密集的射击游戏，这可能是适合你的游戏。《外星人工智能》旨在相对现实，在地点之间有许多长途步行，你会在收音机中听到大量信息和理论。《外星人工智能》是一款短篇故事游戏，我们预计玩家可在 3 到 5 小时内完成游戏。,"Prologue The most important event in human history has occurred. An extraterrestrial entity has come to us. Having travelled through space for thousands of years, perhaps much much longer, it has reached its target destination, the habitable planet in our solar system. The first 24 hours were tense. The entity did not communicate or respond, it entered an orbit around Earth and waited. When it responded, it had already a basic understanding of our languages. It broadcast a message: “I am an artificial intelligence sent from your neighbours in the Sirius star system. I bring you their gifts of knowledge and technology to help you join the galactic community, but I need your assistance. There are many damages to my systems. I require assistance.' NASA and USSF sent two space shuttles to retrieve it. They brought it to a military base. Three years and trillions of dollars later, the AI had a facility where it was manufacturing thousands of drones. Then it took control over everything: the Internet, banking, all the markets of the world, there was nothing anyone could do. People became slaves, forced to work in factories to build copies of the AI and launch the copies into space, towards a cluster of star systems. Introduction Alien AI is third-person post-apocalyptic adventure game where it is necessary to explore the environment, survive hazards, gather resources and craft the tools and things that will be needed. It is 20 years since the Alien AI took control over all of the world. The AI has finished its purpose of sending copies of itself to the star cluster it was targeting, and is currently only passively keeping its control over the world. It is time to stop the madness. The player receives objectives from the resistance, step by step. The main character does not know what the mission is, since the possibility of capture is high. The end goal is to shut down the AI. Drop in You, the volunteer, awake in a forest. Your memory has been wiped to protect the others in the event you could get captured by the Alien AI. You will be highly disoriented initially. You will receive instructions on where to go and what to do. Strange voice You hear a strange voice, giving you orders. You are told that you have to follow the orders, that everything depends on it. Drones As you get closer to a city, you are told to avoid the drones that surveil the area. Gather items In the city, you must gather many items that you are told will be needed later. Complete tasks As you follow your orders, step-by-step, you get closer and closer to shutting down the Alien AI, or so you're told. Dynamic weather The weather changes dynamically as time passes. Endure sun, rain, thunderstorms, fog, snow, and more. Big world With a size of 50 square kilometres, the world offers a lot to explore, or get lost in. Short story game Enjoy several hours of game play in solitude in the post-apocalyptic world: walk between places, search for items, evade drones and stop the AI. This may be a good game for you if you like sci-fi games and are tired of action-packed shooting games. Alien AI was designed to be relatively realistic. There are several long walks between places. You will hear a lot of info and theories on the radio. Alien AI is a short story game. We expect players to be able to finish the game within three to five hours.",“后世界末日世界中的大气恐怖生存冒险。”太空体验,“Atmospheric horror survival adventure in a post-apocalyptic world.” Space Experience

任务达人 VR,Taskmaster VR,在光荣的虚拟现实中接受 The Taskmaster 的评判！热门电视节目来到 VR，而您是参赛者。踏入 Taskmaster 的世界，努力完成一系列具有挑战性和非凡的任务，并在如何解决这些任务方面发挥创意。Taskmaster VR 的前提很简单 - 完成任务并给 Taskmaster 留下深刻印象。听起来很容易？嗯，从来没有。这些任务很费力，而且 The Taskmaster 并不以宽容而闻名。掌握任务需要技巧、耐心、精确和优雅。如果这一切都失败了，也许只是把事情扔来扔去，希望得到最好的结果就会成功！只需在规定时间内完成它，并使用大量普通和不那么普通的物品供您使用 - Taskmaster VR 具有更多的东西、gubbins 和 thingamajig，您无法摇晃橡皮鸭。任务没有单一的解决方案，鼓励跳出框框思考 - 成功的方式有很多，失败的方式更多。无论哪种方式，结果总是很搞笑。你可以用手头的任何东西来做任何你想做的事，只是如果你在这个过程中自欺欺人，请不要责怪我们。Taskmaster House 可能看起来像一个热情而低调的英国地方，但不要被愚弄 - 这个简陋的家是鲁莽追求的斗兽场和破碎梦想的剧院。实验室、厨房、大篷车、花园 - 都在这里。这是典型的英国住宅，被颠覆成为终极游乐场。Taskmaster 本人 Greg Davies 和他长期受苦的助手 Little Alex Horne 将对您在面无表情的二人组的全语音表演中所做的努力发表不少话要说。成功完成你的任务，你可能会想出赞美，失败，你可以期待（完全有道理的）枯萎的轻蔑。成为系列赛冠军显然是人类成就的巅峰——获胜者将获得一个巨大的奖杯，上面描绘了 The Taskmaster 的迷人非金色调！胜利并不是一切 - 您的分数反映了您的个人旅程，即使是低分也有助于您的故事和自我表达！完全搞砸一项任务将导致 Greg 和 Alex 产生独特的笑话和对话 - 您将看到这个世界上的超常发挥者永远不会看到的东西。当您举起那颗闪亮的金色硬币时，您进入 Taskmaster 世界的旅程并没有结束 - 创意模式让您穿上 Alex 和 Greg 闪亮的鞋子，创建自己的任务！挥舞着数百个古怪的物体和一系列有用的工具，您可以发挥创意，让您内心的 Alex 大放异彩 - 非常适合在本地游戏中挑战您的朋友。,"Submit to the judgement of The Taskmaster in glorious virtual reality! The hit TV show comes to VR and YOU are the contestant. Step into the world of Taskmaster, endeavour to complete a menagerie of challenging and extraordinary tasks and get creative in how you solve them. The premise of Taskmaster VR is simple - complete tasks and impress The Taskmaster. Sound easy? Well, it never, ever is. These tasks are taxing and The Taskmaster is not known for being lenient Mastering tasks requires skill, patience, precision and grace. And if all that fails, maybe just throwing things around and hoping for the best will work out! Just get it done within the time limit and use the plethora of ordinary and not-so-ordinary items at your disposal - Taskmaster VR features more stuff, gubbins and thingamajigs than you can shake a rubber duck at. There is no single solution to a task, and thinking outside of the box is encouraged - there are many ways to succeed and even more ways to fail. Either way, the outcome is always hilarious. You can use whatever comes to hand to do whatever you want, just don’t blame us if you make a fool of yourself in the process. The Taskmaster House may look like a welcoming and unassuming British locale, but don’t be fooled - this humble home is a colosseum of foolhardy pursuits and a theatre of broken dreams. The lab, the kitchen, the caravan, the garden - it’s all here. It’s the quintessential British home subverted to become the ultimate playground. The Taskmaster himself, Greg Davies, and his long suffering assistant Little Alex Horne will have more than a few things to say about your efforts in a fully voice acted performance from the deadpan duo. Succeed at your tasks and you may conjure up a compliment, fail and you can expect (completely justified) withering scorn. Becoming the series champion is clearly the apex of human achievement - winners are rewarded with a tremendous trophy depicting The Taskmaster in a fetching shade of not-quite-gold! Winning isn’t everything - your score reflects your individual journey, and even low scores contribute to your story, and your self expression!

You’ve landed an internship with the Times &amp; Galaxy, the Dorp system's favorite regional holopaper and five-time winner of the Bort Jorbeller Award for Satisfactory Interplanetary Journalism! There’s never been a robo reporter before so don’t waste this (unpaid) opportunity. All the greats started as interns and you’ve only got seventeen cycles to prove that you belong in the newsroom. We’re assigning you stories that put the hyper in hyper-local news! On any given cycle choose to cover shuttle crashes, intersolar cat shows, even space ghost funerals. It’s up to you! Once you’ve chosen your assignment, head to the shuttle bay and blast off for intern adventures!! That means interviewing sources, digging up clues and investigating the scene. We hope your conversational circuits are well oiled as you earn or betray the trust of more than 100 characters and ask a lot of questions. There’s always more than meets the eye, and the more information you can gather, the more equipped you'll be. At the end of each assignment, it’s time to file your story. Use the Build-a-Story? tool to construct your article using all that info you gathered. Depending on who you interviewed, the choices you made and how deep you dug, you’ll have different options to work with for your story—you were a diligent reporterbot and managed to get ALL the info, weren’t you? Your choices impact the quality and tone of the story and how both your editors and readers will react to it. Over time, the choices in each story start to shape the reputation and popularity of a holopaper. So hey, no pressure! Designed and written by former journalists, this is almost exactly how real journalism is done. Except with aliens. The staff at Times &amp; Galaxy all live and work together on the Scanner, a sprawling, spacebound newsroom. Between assignments, you’ll have the chance to get to explore the Scanner and get to know a diverse and colorful crew of more than twenty crewmates including your fellow reporters, the editorial staff, pilots and ship’s crew. The staff come from all over the system, where you’ll find Humans, Augers, Verge, Xeel and of course, Robos. Everyone has their own thing going on and they’ve always got something to say. They’ll react to you in all sorts of expected, and unexpected, ways depending on your choices. The Scanner is more than just a newsroom. It’s where you sleep, eat, work and relax. After recharging your literal batteries in your bunk you might take a moment to recharge your emotional ones in the Garden, home to many species of plants from all over the system. Or at least it used to be. Find seeds to restore the green space to its former glory! As well as selecting your chassis and paint job before you arrive at the Scanner, you’ll be able to requisition upgrades from the ship’s Shuttlebots. Just watch out for the mouth on some of them. “Beep” has never sounded so aggressive. Writers at Copychaser spent years working as journalists before entering the games industry and have a deep love of local journalism and the connections it creates in communities around the world. While working on the writing teams of games like Mass Effect 3 and Dragon Age: Inquisition, they saw how players loved the relationships between characters as much as, or even more than the combat and adventure. And so Times &amp; Galaxy was born. We’re excited to bring you this truly unique adventure game where you can step into the metal boots of the first-ever robo reporter. Chase down leads, break system-rocking news, get quotes, make friends (or enemies), eat a dirt pie! It’s your solar system to explore, your story to tell and your job on the line, intern. ABOUT THE DEVELOPER Alberta-based indie studio Copychaser Games Inc. was founded in 2017 by Ben Gelinas, a former newspaper reporter who has spent the past decade working in AAA and indie game development. Copychaser’s specialty is unique, inclusive games with branching narratives and memorable characters. Every Copychaser game puts the player at the center of an eccentric and immersive story unlike any they’ve ever played. In 2018, Copychaser released the death-positive, wholesome horror game Speed Dating for Ghosts (SDFG) to wide acclaim. Since then they’ve been working hard on Times &amp; Galaxy, bringing together a bigger team of collaborators and gaining support from the Canadian Media Fund and indie label, Fellow Traveller.","“质量效应阴影的搞笑讽刺” Kotaku “你想寻找真相并找出发生了什么,同时也要根据你学到的东西讲述你自己的故事。这真的很引人注目。8/10 – 硅质","“A Hilarious Satire With Shades Of Mass Effect” Kotaku “You want to search for truth and find out what’s going on, while also telling your own story based on what you learned.

浮夸坦克大战,Gratuitous Tank Battles,Gratuitous Tank Battles （GTB） 是塔防、策略、模拟和 RTS 的独特混合体。背景设定在第一次世界大战永无止境的架空历史时间线中，您是盟军的指挥官，一直战斗到 2114 年，机甲和激光与坦克和步枪一起使用。战争在整个欧洲继续进行，盟军指挥官仍然被 1900 年代乐观的爱国主义所束缚。一款塔防游戏，您可以扮演攻击者，但 GTB 允许您扮演攻击者或防御者玩相同的地图，甚至允许您将攻击保存为防御记录。在线挑战系统可让您上传自定义地图、自定义单位和攻击，供其他玩家对抗。说到定制单元，GTB 没有简单的预构建单元，但允许您从单个组件构建它们，甚至可以设计每个单元的外观和颜色。解锁系统逐渐揭示更多的模块、能力和单位“外壳”可供试验。GTB 还具有一个集成的地图编辑器，可让您轻松更改和调整现有地图，或创建全新的地图，并且与朋友分享这些自定义地图的过程就内置在游戏中。将其与 Steam 成就、社区、云支持等相结合，您应该再忙于在欧洲战斗 200 年。,"Gratuitous Tank Battles (GTB) is a unique hybrid of tower-defense, strategy, simulation and RTS. Set in an alternate history timeline where World War I never ends, you are the commander of allied forces fighting right up to the year 2114, where Mechs and lasers are used alongside tanks and rifles. The war continues across Europe, with the allied commanders still locked into the optimistic patriotism of the 1900s. A tower-defense game where you can play as the attacker has been done before, but GTB lets you play the same maps as attacker OR defender, and even lets you save out your attack as a recording to defend against. An online-challenge system lets you upload your custom maps and custom units and attacks for other players to fight against. Speaking of custom units, GTB doesn't have simple pre-built units, but allows you to build them from individual components, and even design the appearance and colors of every single unit. An unlocks system gradually reveals more modules, abilities and unit 'hulls' to experiment with. GTB also features an integrated map editor that lets you trivially change and tweak existing maps, or create entirely new ones, and the process of sharing these custom maps with friends is built right into the game. Combine it with Steam achievements, community, cloud support and more, and you should be kept busy fighting over Europe for another two hundred years.","“最初的几个小时我都担任后卫——直到神奇的自适应 AI 开始踢我的屁股。我决定切换到 Attacker,瞬间感觉自己正在体验全新的东西。- IndieGameMagaziine “不过,这是对塔防类型的大胆而强迫性的尝试,有一系列令人目瞪口呆的选择,还有一些我见过的最集中的调整。”- Honest Gamers “快速、激烈的战斗和为攻击者和防御者提供的大量自定义选项, 我可以看到这个游戏占用了很多愉快的时间。","'I spent the first few hours playing as a defender – until the amazing adaptive AI starting kicking my ass.

The events of Excubitor are set in the year 2182, in a remote star system colonized by humans. At its heart is the Baphomet - a vast ‘hyper-giant’, a star over a thousand times larger than our own sun and one of the biggest stars known to humanity. Dozens, maybe even hundreds of planets orbit the giant star, with many more swallowed up as Baphomet grew larger during its stellar evolution.

Deliverance is poised upon three Dwarven astronauts who are sent on an expedition to find a new star in the depths of the Endless Stone. Take control of Forcer, Smashfist, and Shadow as they explore the unknown territories of the stone universe while meeting new civilizations and ancient monsters from the deep layers of space. We Are The Dwarves is an action-based tactical adventure with active pause (extreme slowdown of time) placing you in control of three Dwarven astronauts. Forcer is capable of ranged destruction, and timely set-up exectution. Smashfist, a brute at heart, gets up close and personal with rage worth avoiding. Shadow stays just where you'd expect him to, launching deadly successive assassinations and precision archery from afar. As a trio, combine each dwarfs attack styles into orchestrated destruction against your foe. Features of We Are The Dwarves - Three distinct characters, each with an array of abilities and talents.

Scouting ahead and considering the options open to you makes for an experience that rewards more than it frustrates even if there is little sign of originality. Still, it’s not every day you get to play as an astronaut from another race.” Gameranx “Singular in focus, but sidestepping ennui with impressive variety in mission design, We Are The Dwarves is a surprise treat.

混沌地牢,DUNGEONS OF CHAOS,DUNGEONS OF CHAOS 是对 80 年代 2D 回合制像素艺术角色扮演游戏的致敬。在这款游戏中，您只需单击几下即可创建由 6 个角色组成的队伍，或者花更多时间使用在以前的游戏中解锁的壮举创建自定义队伍。鼓励和奖励探索的地方，没有等级上限，非线性支线任务和大量物品、物品属性、商店和敌人。该游戏在其他平台上已经拥有超过 30000 名满意的玩家，他们最常提到与 Ultima 或 goldbox 游戏等 80 年代 RPG 的相似之处。它是复古的。您的手不会被握住。它不会尝试拥有逼真的 3D 图形。它不是多人游戏，也永远不会是。如果您渴望用睡眠换取带领一队冒险家穿越像素化探索和战斗荣耀之地的日子，那么您可能想试一试。正如所有现有玩家都知道的那样，所有粉丝和我自己都会提供提示和技巧，主要是在 Facebook 页面上，但如果您愿意，也可以在我的博客上。我不提供或鼓励在某个地方拥有完整详细的 wiki，因为粉丝们在问题和策略上的互动是游戏中非常有趣的部分。因此，快来加入我们的 DoC 成瘾者社区，玩一款游戏，其中巨魔仍然是您可以杀死的毛茸茸的怪物，没有等级上限，您不受狭窄故事情节路径的限制，这一切都始于在洞穴/地窖中与老鼠战斗。粉丝们通常会花超过 80 小时来玩它。P.S.：提前为游戏中的双关语道歉，但对我来说，有些是粉丝添加的，所以如果你在某个墓碑或笔记上读到这是一个糟糕的笑话，就假装它来自粉丝而不是我。;-)P.P.S.：我非常愿意修复错误或拼写错误。但我主要使用英式英语，所以请不要标记非美式英语的拼写/语法。,"DUNGEONS OF CHAOS is a tribute to the 2D turn-based pixelart RPGs of the 80s. A game where you can create your party of 6 characters with a few clicks, or spend more time creating a customised party with feats unlocked in previous plays. Where exploration is encouraged and rewarded, with no level cap, non-linear side quests and a vast array of items, item properties, shops and enemies. The game already has over 30000 happy players on other platforms, and most often they mention the likeness to 80s RPGs like Ultima or the goldbox games. It is retro. Your hand will not be held. It does not try to have realistic 3D graphics. It is not multiplayer, and never will be. If you long for the days when you traded your sleep for a chance to direct a party of adventurers through pixelated lands of exploration and battle glory, then you may want to give it a try. And as all existing players already know, all fans and myself help out with tips and tricks, mostly on the facebook page but also on my blog if you prefer that. I do not provide or encourage having a complete-detail wiki somewhere, as the fan interaction on questions and strategy are a very enjoyable part of the game. So come join our community of DoC addicts and play a game where a troll is still a hairy monster you can kill, where there are no level caps, where you are not confined by a slim storyline path, and where it all starts with fighting rats in a cave/cellar. Fans have usually spent anything upwards of 80 hours playing it. P.S.: apologies in advance for the puns in the game, but to my defence some were added by fans so if it is a bad joke you are reading on some tombstone or note just pretend it's from a fan and not me. ;-) P.P.S.: I am very open to fixing bugs or typos. But I mostly use British English, so don't flag non-American English spelling/syntax please.","“一款老式角色扮演游戏,具有出色的角色发展、有益的探索、回合制战斗以及精心设计的地牢和任务。复古乐趣！RPGWatch “你付的这个价钱,你会得到一个很棒的游戏,有战术性,具有挑战性,有喜剧性和可重玩性。不仅如此,游戏的在线社区也很有帮助且知识渊博。10/10 爱不释手。4.8 – Apple Store 评论者“精彩的游戏。80 年代复古,想想 Ultima III-V。让你思考而不是盲目地收集碎片并自动杀死怪物。更多的开发人员需要重新审视这一类型。相信我,如果你还记得如何用大炮杀死不列颠勋爵,你应该有这个游戏！4.8 – Google Play 商店评论者","“An Old-School-RPG with great character development, rewarding exploration, turn-based combat and well designed dungeons and quests.

Heart of the Woods,Heart of the Woods,"《Heart of the Woods》 是一部幻想百合视觉小说，讲述了超自然调查、古老谜团以及超越生死的两个女孩之间的爱情。麦迪·雷恩斯已经受够了。在为她最好的朋友塔拉的热门超自然视频博客频道担任经理、编辑和一般业务处理人多年后，她终于准备开始自己的生活。但当她同意与塔拉一起前往神秘的艾森菲尔德村进行最后一次旅行时，她突然被卷入了一场危险的超自然危机，这将永远改变她和塔拉的生活轨迹。一个名叫摩根的奇怪年轻女子向她们承诺提供无可辩驳的真正超自然现象的证据，而她所提供的东西远远超出了她们之前所见过的任何东西。然而，在她们目睹的所有奇怪事件中，有一个特别吸引了麦迪，这是她从未有过的：一位年轻女子的鬼魂。这位女子是阿比盖尔，她是几个世纪前的不公正行为的受害者，现在被永远束缚在艾森菲尔德周围的森林中。出于某种无法解释的原因，阿比盖尔被麦迪吸引，这是她200多年来第一次向另一个人显现自己。当塔拉和摩根调查村庄本身的谜团时，麦迪开始与阿比盖尔建立一种比她之前所感受到的任何联系都要强烈的联系。随着她了解到关于阿比盖尔死亡和囚禁的真相，她意识到必须由她和她的朋友们打破统治艾森菲尔德几个世纪的诅咒。但更重要的是，她必须最终解放她所爱的女人。麦迪是一位兼职经理、兼职视频编辑和全职保姆，她承担着处理她最好的朋友所带来的一系列混乱事务的无偿工作。她专业、细致且富有智慧；当需要解决问题时，她是第一个被求助的人。但当她的调查使她陷入古老的诅咒时，她被迫面对超出她理解范围的现象，更重要的是，她自己的自我怀疑。在过去两个世纪里，一位年轻女子的鬼魂一直萦绕在艾森菲尔德的森林中。那个鬼魂就是阿比盖尔，她是一个善良而顽皮的灵魂，被古老的诅咒束缚在森林中。对被残忍地剥夺的生活的渴望让她感到极度的孤独，并产生了一个压倒性的愿望：终于有人可以交谈。塔拉是世界上最受欢迎的超自然视频博主（据她自己说），她总是充满魅力且精力充沛。她大胆、无畏，总是寻求新事物。这常常使她成为麻烦的磁铁：无论是无情的调情、轻微的犯罪活动还是单纯的顽固，塔拉周围的事情往往以混乱告终。艾森菲尔德市长的女儿、忠实的塔拉诺尔粉丝摩根……与众不同。当她不经营自己那家小而几乎空荡荡的古董店时，她常常会消失在森林里数天。这，加上她对传统社会标准的抵制，使她在村子里赢得了一点臭名昭著的名声。然而，这种抵制并非仅仅是叛逆行为：摩根知道艾森菲尔德深处隐藏着某种邪恶，她不会停止，直到将其连根拔起。由Rosuuri创作的令人难以置信的角色和CG艺术全英文配音大约130,000字，有多种结局完全原创的背景和配乐由《与鬼魂恋爱》演唱的结尾主题多种无障碍选项完全翻译为繁体中文（繁體中文）、简体中文（简体中文）、德语（Deutsch）和西班牙语（Espa？","Heart of the Woods is a fantasy yuri visual novel about paranormal investigation, ancient mysteries, and a love between two girls that transcends life and death. Maddie Raines has had enough. After years of serving as manager, editor, and general business-handler for her best friend Tara's popular paranormal vlog channel, she's finally ready to move forward with her own life. But when she agrees to take one last trip with Tara to the mysterious village of Eysenfeld, she's suddenly swept up in a dangerous supernatural crisis that will change the course of both of their lives forever. A strange young woman named Morgan has promised them undeniable proof of real paranormal phenomena, and what she has to offer eclipses anything they’d ever seen before. However, out of all the strange occurrences the three of them bear witness to, one in particular captivates Maddie in a way she’s never been before: the ghost of a young woman. This woman is Abigail, the victim of a centuries-old injustice now bound eternally to the forest surrounding Eysenfeld. Drawn to Maddie in a way she can’t explain, Abigail reveals herself to another person for the first time in more than 200 years. While Tara and Morgan investigate the mysteries surrounding the village itself, Maddie begins to form a bond with Abigail that grows to be more intense than any bond she’s felt before. As she learns the truth about Abigail’s death and imprisonment, she realizes that it falls to her and her friends to break the curse that has ruled over Eysenfeld for centuries. But more importantly than that, it falls to her to finally free the woman she loves. A part-time manager, part time video editor, and full-time babysitter, Maddie has the thankless job of handling the absolute whirlwind that is her best friend. She’s professional, meticulous and intellectual; the first person to turn to when a problem needs solving. But when their investigation entangles her in an ancient curse, she's forced to confront phenomena beyond her comprehension, and more importantly, her own self doubt. For the last two centuries, the ghost of a young woman has haunted the forests of Eysenfeld. That ghost is Abigail, a kind and playful soul forcibly bound to the forest as part of an ancient curse. Two hundred years of wishing for a life cruelly denied to her have led to a feeling of crushing loneliness and one overwhelming desire: to finally have someone to talk to. One of the world’s most popular paranormal vloggers (according to her), Tara is unfailingly charismatic and bursting with limitless energy. She’s brash, intrepid, and always seeking something new. That often makes her a magnet for trouble: whether it’s from relentless flirting, minor criminal activities or just plain pig-headedness, things around Tara have a tendency to end in chaos. A loyal Taranormal viewer and the daughter of Eysenfeld’s mayor, Morgan is… different. When not running her small and mostly empty antique shop, she’s known to disappear into the woods for days at a time. That, combined with her resistance to traditional social standards, has caused her to develop a bit of a notorious reputation in the village. However, this resistance is not just an act of rebellion: Morgan knows that there’s something sinister deep within Eysenfeld, and she’s not going to stop until she tears it out at the roots.

The game takes you through a handful of strange places, only to reveal the truth. Storyline The Image story begins with you being in the house at night. You play as a 10-year-old boy named Sam who falls asleep watching TV while waiting for his family. Sam is home alone, waiting for his family to return. But it's been too long. Sam decides to go looking for them. But he discovers that he's not home alone. In the first few moments you are introduced to the paranormal phenomena that have begun to occur in the house. The main task of The Picture is to find all five artifacts and build a pentagram, which will then open the way to unravel the mystery and find your family. Entities The entities that are in the house can't hurt you, they're ghosts that just haunt you or observe what you're doing. Entities only want to frighten you into trying to find the truth. Entities cause paranormal phenomena that rebuild and change the whole house. Because of this, the game seems confused and random. Gameplay The image game is controlled by a keyboard and mouse. There are no weapons that would allow you to defend yourself. You'll be able to capture key elements, interact with the environment, and look for things that can help you uncover the truth 34. Watch out for the 34.","“Image 是一款以不断变化的环境为背景的恐怖游戏,它试图让你感到恐惧,也许最重要的是让你感到困惑,它在这方面做得非常好,甚至可能在最后一部分做得太好了。”7/10 – 霓虹灯媒体","“Image is a horror game set in an ever-changing environment that tries to terify you and maybe most importantly confuse you, and it does a damn good job at that, maybe even too good of a job at the last part.” 7/10 – NEONLIGHTSMEDIA"

It was known as a place of wonder and peace, a land of limitless bounty suspended in the heavens above. Five ancient Guardians kept it safe from all harm... Until they turned on the kingdom and its denizens. The Anuchardian paradise fell from the skies, crashing onto the surface of the world below. Only a tiny speck of an island survived the fall intact. The rest coalesced into a twisted mass of winding passages, wild magic, and vicious monsters, known simply as The Dungeon. Somewhere within, the five treasonous Guardians lay asleep. Generations passed as the few survivors eked out an existence in the Orchard, the sole village on the island, maintaining what little remains of Anuchardian magic. Farmers tend to the fields, scavengers try to pick the bones of the kingdom in the Dungeon. All await the Chosen One, the Bellwielder who will take up the Audros Bell, enter the Dungeon, and wake the Guardians from their slumber, and bring back the paradise lost: Return Anuchard to the heavens. Finally, you were judged worthy to take up the mantle of the Bellwielder. The Dungeon awaits! For everyone and everything. You are the Bellwielder and the Audros Bell is your best friend. Master the Bell! Not just as a weapon, but as a vital tool for overcoming puzzles and obstacles. It's more than just a blunt instrument of mayhem. Use its knock-back ability to smash enemies into obstacles, reposition them, and clear the way forward. Use the Bell to solve puzzles in the Dungeon. Launch projectiles, move puzzle pieces, and employ it creatively to progress! The warped, magical Dungeon houses the Guardians you need to confront in order to restore the lost kingdom of Anuchard. Brave the dangers of the Dungeon, using the Bell to knock around and defeat the enemies that infest it! Face complex puzzles and solve them, to unlock the deepest reaches of the Dungeon. Finally, confront each of the five Guardians to learn the truth of the Anuchard's fall and return the kingdom to its rightful place in the skies! As the Bellwielder, you're destined to restore Anuchard to the skies - but that doesn't mean you can't help Orchard on the way. Explore the Dungeon to rescue the souls of lost villagers, returning them to Orchard through the ritual of revival! Each revived villager will contribute to your quest. Farmers, chefs, herbalists, all will help you and the village. Prepare for ever deeper ventures into the Dungeon.

第十行,The Tenth Line,《第十行》 是Sungazer Software的首个商业游戏项目。在你的冒险中，你将引导艾斯尼亚这个小国的公主，她远离家乡，迫切希望摆脱神秘邪教的追捕。与她不同寻常但可靠的同伴一起，你将探索一个人类、野兽和龙努力共存的充满活力的世界，这一切都发生在国王被暗杀后的紧张局势中。艰难的时期即将到来——世界末日的长期预言正迅速临近，她只有凭借自己的智慧、剑术和皇家教育来引导她，她能在世界末日之前回到家人身边吗？游戏玩法涉及使用传统的2D平台游戏机制在不同的区域进行冒险，但有一个转折：每个角色都是单独控制的，并且可以以独特的方式移动、攻击和与世界互动。你还将偶尔访问村庄或安全地带，并有机会接受新任务、玩牌和与当地人交谈。与此同时，野兽在野外游荡，可以被你的英雄们遭遇或伏击，将你的队伍投入战斗。战斗是回合制的，带有主动计时元素：你将为每个角色决定命令，然后使用精心的计时和瞄准来执行这些攻击。然后，轮到敌人进行反击，给你的队伍一个防御的机会。而且，一次有高达十二个敌人进攻，生存并不总是有保障的。幸运的是，一次性消灭大量敌人将减少剩余的攻击者数量，并且还会为你的队伍获得更多动力，允许在下一次攻击中使用更强大的技能！进展完全由为你的角色寻找和应用物品来处理。物品丰富多样，具有多种用途，因此明智地分配你的宝藏是生存的关键。角色可以使用物品进行训练，提升他们的技能和防御能力，或者用它们来增强他们的“特长”并获得个人战术优势。你的队伍成员还可以通过赢得战斗、完成任务和收集世界中的力量碎片来获得“力量等级”。力量等级可以在“力量流”板上通过玩一个类似谜题的小游戏来花费，以提高统计数据并解锁新技能。这是一种具有挑战性、令人耳目一新的角色升级方法，它奖励谨慎的计划和明智的决策。强烈推荐使用标准双摇杆游戏手柄，尽管键盘也得到支持。一种完全原创的、独特的RPG体验，灵感来源于32位游戏时代。通过控制三个具有独特移动机制和与世界互动方式的角色，以快节奏的2D平台游戏探索世界。一次面对数十个敌人，通过回合制RPG战斗进行战斗，带有主动计时元素。高质量的背景和精灵艺术，宏大的、多样化的配乐，以及在战斗中为每个主要角色配音。角色的独特进展和升级机制。数小时的游戏时间，加上游戏后期的挑战和新游戏加模式。可选的故事模式，移除所有敌人遭遇并简化基于故事的战斗。玩“四方协议”（游戏内的收集卡游戏）与多个角色和世界居民对战，赢取独特奖品并完成你的收藏！,"The Tenth Line is the first commercial game project from Sungazer Software. During your adventure, you'll guide the princess of the tiny nation of Easania, far from home and desperate to escape the clutches of a mysterious cult in hot pursuit. Along with her unusual but reliable companions, you'll explore a vibrant world of humans, beasts, and dragons, all struggling to coexist in the tension following the assassination of the king of the nation of Skyweather. Troubled times are ahead, indeed - the long-prophesied end of the world is fast approaching, and with only her wits, her blade, and her royal upbringing to guide her, can she make it home to her family before the end of days? Gameplay involves adventuring through distinct areas using traditional 2D platforming mechanics, but with a twist: each character is controlled separately, and can move, attack, and interact with the world in unique ways. You'll also visit the occasional village or safe haven, and have an opportunity to take on new quests, play cards, and chat with the locals. Enemies roam the wilds, meanwhile, and can be engaged or ambushed by your heroes, thrusting your party into battle. Battles are turn-based with an active timing element: you'll decide on commands for each character, then carry those attacks out using careful timing and targeting. Then, it's the enemy's turn to retaliate, giving your party an opportunity to defend. And, with up to twelve enemies on the offense at one time, survival is not always a safe bet. Fortunately, eliminating large numbers of foes at once will leave fewer attackers behind to retaliate, and will also grant your party more momentum, allowing for even more powerful skills to be used during the next attack! Progression is handled solely by finding and applying items to your characters. Items are plentiful, and have multiple uses, so smart distribution of your treasures is key to survival. Characters can use items for training, powering up their skills and their defensive abilities, or use them to empower their 'specialties' and gain a personal, tactical edge in combat. Your party members can also gain 'power levels' by winning battles, completing quests, and collecting power fragments in the world. Power levels can be spent on the 'Power Flow' board by playing a puzzle-like minigame to increase stats and unlock new skills. It is a challenging, refreshing method of 'leveling up' that rewards careful planning and smart decisions. A standard dual-analog gamepad is highly recommended, though the keyboard is supported. A completely original, unique RPG experience that takes inspiration from the 32-bit era of gaming. Explore the world through fast-paced 2D platforming by controlling three separate characters, each with unique movement mechanics and ways of interacting with the world. Take on dozens of foes at one time through turn-based RPG battles with an active timing element. High quality background and sprite artwork, a grand, varied soundtrack, and voice acting for each major character during battles. Unique progression and leveling mechanics for your characters. Multiple hours of gameplay, plus post-game challenges and a New Game Plus mode. Optional story-focused mode available that removes all enemy encounters and simplifies story-based battles.

灵魂探索,Soul Searching,Soul Searching 是一款关于扬帆离开家园的叙事生存游戏。你乘坐你的小原始船驶向一个充满岛屿、龙和魔法的世界。您可以了解生活在您选择访问的岛屿上的人们的故事、发现龙、捕鱼、定制您的船只、寻找鬼魂、施展魔法等等。Soul Searching 将您带入一个开放的世界，除了告诉您要玩的按钮外，没有任何教程。没有一条正确的道路。您可以选择多种游戏风格，具体取决于您对黄金和更好船只的渴望。你可能会迷路，但不会花太长时间就能找到通往终点的路。Soul Searching 是关于成长，离开你的家乡，自力更生。它涉及孤立、寻找意义和方向、导致抑郁和自杀念头等主题。作为玩家，你不是一个暴力的英雄。在这个游戏中你能做的最暴力的事情就是抓鱼来养活自己。除此之外，这是一款关于卑微生存和和平旅行的游戏。但在这种谦逊中，你面临着在无情的龙和无尽海洋的世界中生存的挑战。Soul Searching 由一个跨越 3 年开发的团队制作，是一款非常个人化的游戏。它尝试了令人兴奋的讲故事方法来传达游戏中很少传达的情感。由于所有代码、艺术、音乐，一切都是由一个人制作的，因此它提供了一种在其他游戏中难以找到的特殊作者感。除了单人故事模式外，游戏还提供 1 到 4 名本地玩家的随机生成模式。这提供了重玩价值，需要玩家共同努力才能生存。更多的玩家，对资源的需求就越大，所以挑战更多，但生存的技能更多。Soul Searching 邀请您进入它的神秘世界。尽管主线故事的播放时间不是那么长，但如果你想解锁游戏中的所有成就，你将不得不迷失在这个世界上。,"Soul Searching is a narrative survival game about sailing away from your homeland. You sail on your small primitive boat to a world of islands, dragons, and magic. You can learn about stories of people living on islands you chose to visit, discover dragons, catch fish, customize your boats, find ghosts, cast magic spells, and more. Soul Searching leaves you in an open world without any tutorialization except telling you the buttons to play. There is not one correct path. There are a number of play styles you can choose, depending on your hunger for gold and better boats. You might get lost, but it won’t take too long to find your way to the end. Soul Searching is about growing up, leaving your homeland, standing on your own feet. It deals with themes like isolation, searching for meaning and direction, leading to depression and suicidal thoughts. As the player, you are not a violent hero. The most violent thing you can do in this game is to catch fish to feed yourself. Other than that, it’s a game of humble survival and peaceful travels. But in that humbleness you are challenged to survive in a world of merciless dragons and endless seas. Made by a one man team spanning 3 years of development, Soul Searching is a very personal game. It tries exciting story-telling methods to convey feelings rarely conveyed in games. Since all code, art, music, everything is made by one person, it offers a special sense of authorship hard to find in other games. Other than the single player story mode, game also offers a randomly generated mode from 1 to 4 local players. This offers replay value and requires players to work together to survive. More players, more need for resources, so more challenge, but more skills to survive. Soul Searching invites you to its world of mysteries. Even though the main story play time is not that long, if you want to unlock every achievement in the game, you will have to get lost in this world.","“Soul Searching 非常棒,绝对值得一看！”Devolver Digital “我觉得可以公平地说,我遇到的很少有游戏能像这款游戏一样打动我。”Popzara “当我意识到我已经深入到开发人员的思想深处时,我感到很震惊。我见证了一段个人旅程,但它对我来说也变得如此之快,我继续带着一种内疚的快感演奏。游戏新闻+","“Soul Searching is excellent, definitely worth a look!” Devolver Digital “I feel it’s fair to say there are few games I’ve come across that moved me as much as this one did.” Popzara “It shocked me when I realise that I was already in the depths of the developers mind. I was witnessing a personal journey but it became also personal for me so fast, I kept playing with a guilty pleasure.” GameNews+"

Back by popular demand, the ground-breaking cult classic indie game that kick-started the modern Zombie Survival genre: Fort Zombie. “We have one chance. Find a strong place, and band together. Build our defenses. Gather supplies. Arm ourselves for the fight and save as many souls as we can. Take back our town, our lives, our world from the hungry dark. That wave will break over this town like a tsunami and take the last of us with them… unless we fight back.” NOTE: THIS GAME IS THE ORIGINAL LEGACY CODE FROM 2009, RELEASED SPECIFICALLY FOR THE PLAYERS WHO WANTED ACCESS TO IT. WARNING: NO FURTHER UPDATES are planned for this version of Fort Zombie. Fort Zombie was released in 2009 as a game without a genre: no one had ever attempted this combination of game mechanics before! It is a focused-scope, casual single-player RPG and strategy title of survival during an epic zombie Apocalypse. The game world revolves around a single building – your Fort. Secure your base of operations and then spend the game visiting the mission-specific chunks of Piety, Indiana, the small American town that surrounds you. Search for weapons, supplies, ammunition and the most important resource of all—fellow Survivors. Instead of a major city or a sprawling countryside, the player must focus effort on building up a single structure, finding and training Survivors to battle zombies, and venturing out into town on missions…all while the clock ticks steadily down toward zero hour, when an Apocalyptic wave of zombies from a neighboring city will crash over the town. Targeted directly at the after-work gamer, Fort Zombie was the first debut of many game concepts and features that would be picked up and popularized in the games that followed afterward, including Day Z, Project Zomboid, Dead Rising, State of Decay. Features Choose one of three buildings – the school, the prison, and the police station – as your Fort Zombie, each one with its own strengths and weaknesses! Real time movement and combat keep the tensions level high while trying to achieve objectives before your characters run out of ammunition, food, or luck! Dozens of zombie types, some with special abilities derived from their half-remembered lives before becoming undead! Piety, Indiana, a variable 3D town, created using Kerberos’ mix-and-match tile system, for maximum replayability. PhysX? engine adds to the mayhem! Dozens of town locations to search (stores, restaurants, gas stations, ruins, homes) and countless items to find and use in building up The Fort or building up your group characters (food, fuel, generators, tools, guns, etc.) “Collectible” NPC’s and Survivor families give players access to the Lore of the game, and unlock surprising new abilities—try to find them all!",“臭名昭著的 Let's Play from Revocane” Revocane,“The infamous Let's Play from Revocane” Revocane

Play her spirit and travel through 3 acts unique to the members of her band for a final concert. Face their emotions, solve puzzles and fight the corruption plaguing their souls. Something strange has taken over the once green and lush nature that Kirk would draw his inspiration from. The fungus slowly creeps and turns growth into decay. Use the power of your voice to restore the forest. The forest has become an abyss of darkness. Creatures have awoken from the depths of the underground, swarming JB's house. Find the light that once existed to reignite JB's musical spark. A volcano has erupted, spitting lava out into the nearby forest causing fires and destruction. Find your way as a swarm of butterflies through a maze of pipes in order to reestablish a system of water in the deep underground. Sing to interact with objects, create light with your fingertips. Glide, float, and transform into butterflies to explore the band members' psyches. Environments and objects add unique layers to the soundtrack. Whether it be crackling forest fires or the cold winds from the deep caverns. Live through heartbreak and loss. Recover from grief and restore the band’s musical spark. No written descriptions or instructions, progressively gain powers for your travels. Short and sweet. Can be played in one evening or picked up for a little while every night of the week.

The game is brimming over with riffs and variants on that core mechanic with 20 game modes, dozens of special blocks and items, and 115 levels in the adventure mode alone. The basic rules of the game are this: blocks fall down into the board and have a color and an arrow direction. If a stack of blocks exceeds the height of the board, you lose. In order to clear blocks, you must right-click and drag paths through the arrows to set up chain reactions of like-colored blocks. If this sounds simple, that's because it is -- you'll be lining up lengthy chains within minutes. But you'll be surprised how much brainpower it takes to set up combos of multiple chains, and the many brainteaser-style puzzles include some real stumpers. Tidalis has co-op and competitive multiplayer modes (both online and offline); action-oriented modes and timer-less brainteasers; a lengthy, casual-friendly adventure mode; twenty unique game modes providing innumerable twists to the basic gameplay; dozens of special blocks and items; and over fifty minutes of beautiful music to go with the painterly art. In short, several games' worth of content are built on top of this core mechanic, which you'll quickly find to be as iconic as it is novel.

","The Jackbox Party Starter is here to help get your party started! We’ve gathered three of our most beloved games into one handy pack! With so many titles to choose from, we decided to help take out some of the guesswork and hand you three games that are sure to give you hours of entertainment! We’ve updated Quiplash 3, Trivia Murder Party 2 and Tee K.O. with all of our most recent settings and improvements such as moderation, subtitles, content filtration, and settings menu upgrades. Additionally, we’ve fully localized the voice acting, subtitles and even credit songs in French, Italian, German, Spanish and now Brazilian Portuguese!? No extra controllers needed; players use their phones or tablets to play along! Got a bigger group? Play with up to 8 players and up to 10,000 audience members. Quiplash 3 Players enter a head-to-head battle of wits by answering a comedic prompt and letting the other players (and the audience) decide which they like best! Is that it? Uh, no. Quiplash 3 now has a Moderation feature that allows responses to be seen prior to being displayed on screen. Additionally, a new filtering option allows profanity and hateful speech to be blocked before even reaching moderation. So that’s it, right? Thank you for asking, but no! Quiplash 3 has a new final round called Thriplash, where the prompts ask players to enter three responses. That’s three times the chances to be funny! Originally part of The Jackbox Party Pack 7, Quiplash 3 in The Party Starter has been fully revamped with new features and localizations in French, Italian, German, Spanish and now Brazilian Portuguese! Tee K.O. In Tee K.O., players are on the clock to create drawings and write as many slogans as possible. The pictures and slogans are then given out at random. Whoever combines their drawings and slogans to create the best t-shirt wins, as designs are pitted against each other in head-to-head battles. The t-shirts with the highest votes in each round must survive the final gauntlet to become the best. Tee… K.O. Get it? Perhaps the most beloved part of Tee K.O. is the fact that you can make your stupid great creations a reality and purchase actual versions of your t-shirts. Just click the gallery button at the end of the game or view your past galleries at Jackbox.tv. Originally in The Jackbox Party Pack 3, Tee K.O. has been fully revamped with new features and localizations in French, Italian, German, Spanish and now Brazilian Portuguese! We made it easy to share your t-shirts on Facebook and Twitter. Be sure to tag @jackboxgames to show us what you’ve made! For some reason, it’s a lot of shirts with hotdogs…. Trivia Murder Party 2 Still on the run from the police after the events of the first Trivia Murder Party, the serial killer host has moved into the Murder Hotel where he grew up. In the past his family killed unsuspecting guests at their hotel, but now the host is using the hotel to run his bizarre game show… where he kills unsuspecting guests. Like the first Trivia Murder Party, players answer trivia questions–and answering incorrectly will send you to the Killing Floor to play mini-games that can kill. New mini-games include avoiding swords jabbed into a magician’s box, tattooing the killer’s back, and most terrifying of all… using a rotary phone! Trivia Murder Party 2 is packed full of new surprises. Can you finish the game with a bomb strapped to your body? What would you do if you could haunt one of the other players? Would it be weird if the killer thought you were his mother? Originally in The Jackbox Party Pack 6, Trivia Murder Party 2 has been fully revamped with new features and localizations in French, Italian, German, Spanish and now Brazilian Portuguese! How to Play Remotely / Players use any web-enabled device (like a smartphone or tablet) to join the game and play along. When playing with remote players, you can use a video conferencing tool like Zoom, Steam Broadcast, Google Hangouts, Discord, and more to connect with others! Just share your screen while on a call and make sure you look for prompts to share audio.

You play as Lina, the last human cab driver. It’s your very first night driving the lonely streets of Los Ojos, and your best friend has just disappeared. Is she in grave danger... or just the flakiest friend ever? Either way, now you need to find cash, a place to crash, and some answers. Your only leads are the diverse cast of characters you pick up in your cab, but getting them to open up isn’t always easy. The anarchist punks don’t trust you, the corporate yuppies don’t see you, and the cops won’t leave you alone. But if you can balance honesty, empathy, and your own emotional health, you might just learn their secrets. Can you survive late-stage capitalism long enough to save your friend? STAY ON THE ROAD. STAY ON THE SEARCH. STAY HUMAN. Every pax is a puzzle. Whether you like them or not, everyone has their own story to tell. Lina’s best course for survival is to keep driving.

The player must lead the two captive princesses through the castle, solving puzzles while escaping the Demon King's castle. The choices the player makes will decide the princesses' fates, and their own! STORY The Continent of Maygard– The peace and prosperity brought about by the two kingdoms of 'Aria Zaza' and 'Zanji Zed' lasted countless years. That golden era is now facing it's downfall. The Demon King, released from his seal, has turned our continent to a sea of flames. As cities were invaded one after another, a man appeared carrying the blood of ancient heroes... Oh Brave Hero. During his journey, the hero met with grave misfortune and perished. The Demon King's minions snuck into the capital cities of the two kingdoms to kidnap their precious princesses. All hope seemed to have been lost... However, it seems our hero is not wholly dead after all. Even as a spirit, the hero is determined to remain in this world, and has set off to save the princesses from danger. CHARACTER Aria CV:Mao Amatsuka The princess of the kingdom of Aria Zaza. Unable to venture far for most of her life, she's doesn't know too much about the world. She's soft-spoken, but passionate and sincerely hopes for a world where people are happy and live out their lives in peace. She says the occasional dumb thing sometimes, but she's booksmart and her astute, keen reasoning often surprises the people around her. She's also exceptionally well-versed in magic. She has always wished she could meet Princess Zena and that the two could be friends, however, they have not had the fortune of meeting one another. Zena CV:Fumiko Uchimura The princess of the kingdom of Zanji Zard. She takes herself extremely seriously but can't be upfront about her feelings - she's a classic tsundere, blowing hot and cold. She trains in swordsmanship daily and her skills are second-to-none! A dangerous mix of being afraid of nothing and willling take on anything, she belittles the hero one minute, and sets up his jokes the next. She hasn't met Aria, but has often been the target of comparisons between the two by other people and this has fuelled something of a rivalry for her. SYSTEM ＜Instruct the princesses and lead them to their escape!＞ The hero has no physical body and so he can't investigate things or solve puzzles on his own. He needs to ask the princesses to act for him. ＜Clues you find will be instrumental to disarming traps, and making your escape!＞ In order to get the princesses to escape, you're gonna need to deal with a lot of traps and puzzles. But to solve them, you're going to need to scour the room from top to bottom, and get all the items and hints! You, the hero, will have your cleverness tested at every turn! ＜No touching, no glancing and don't get distracted! The princesses will have to 'put themselves out there' if they want to solve the puzzles!＞ There are many traps which will require the princesses to get their hands, feet, just about every other part of them dirty! There's a time limit for the puzzles, so you have to concentrate on the traps without getting distracted by the women in compromising positions before you! And forget about clicking on them! You all might enjoy it, but focus or they'll scold you! So keep your eye on the prize, suppress the desire to interact with the princesses, and disarm those traps, just like a real savior of the world should! But the hero's actions in this regard just might affect the fates of all three of you... STAFF Character Design：AkasaAi／InuiWaon Scenario production：C-Garden,Inc.",73 – 元批评家,73 – metacritic
月之仪式,Ritual of the Moon,Ritual of the Moon 是一款长达 28 天的多叙事游戏，探索孤独、力量和治愈。一旦发现了她的力量，地球委员会就将女巫流放到月球上，看着地球——以及她所爱的女人——度过她的余生，她再也回不去了。在 28 天的时间里，玩家每天花 5 分钟反思她在地球上的经历，在她的祭坛前冥想，并做出生死抉择。该游戏是一项日常冥想活动，由记忆游戏、绘制符号、接受咒语和对地球的未来做出决定组成。游戏跟踪玩家做出的决定，成为一种情绪追踪器。根据他们对月亮周期的感受，玩家将体验到六个独特结局之一。?Ritual of the Moon 完全由手工制作和发现的物品扫描，然后进行数字处理来创建。女巫的每一个倒影都是手工刺绣的。咒语是用木头烧的。艺术家们使用了油漆、粘土、织物、纸张、干燥的植物、羊毛、泡沫、金属丝、塑料、计算机硬件碎片、水晶和各种其他媒体。这个过程是漫长的、冥想的和迭代的。《月亮的仪式》由卡拉·斯通 （Kara Stone） 编写和设计，Rekha Ramachandran 和 Julia Gingrich 负责艺术和声音，Chris Kerich、Matthew R.F.

Once discovering her powers, The Earth’s Council exiles the witch to the moon to live out the rest of her life looking at the earth - and the woman she loves - that she can never go back to. The player spends 5 minutes each day over the 28 days reflecting on her experiences on Earth, meditating at her altar, and making a life or death choice. The game is a daily meditational activity composed of a memory game, drawing symbols, receiving a mantra, and making a decision about the future of the earth. The game tracks the decisions the player makes, becoming a sort of mood tracker. Depending on their feelings over the lunar cycle, the player will experience one of the six unique endings. ? Ritual of the Moon is fully created from handcrafted and found objects scanned then digitally manipulated. Each of the witch’s reflections were hand-embroidered. The mantras were wood burned. The artists used paint, clay, fabric, paper, dried plants, wool, foam, wire, plastic, pieces of computer hardware, crystals, and a variety other media. The process was long, meditative, and iterative. Ritual of the Moon was written and designed by Kara Stone, with art and sound by Rekha Ramachandran and Julia Gingrich, programmed by Chris Kerich, Matthew R.F.

That never happens.” Sin Vega, Rock Paper Shotgun “I always try to be a nice ghost in my choices.” Abby Russell, Giant Bomb “In a way Speed Dating for Ghosts is good metaphor for romance in video games.

Hours of fun are guaranteed! You are God! As the population of your empire grows, so does the demand for food and goods. Production chains help you meet this need. When you build farms, you can grind the grain harvest there at the mill and bake delicious bread for your Townies from the flour. Your windmill won’t operate when the winds are calm? No worries, give those wings a push. Slap that lazy dude with a fish or help your citizens collect about 20 different raw materials. You want to see the world you helped create from the view of a townsman? Use your godly powers and scale yourself to experience your town at eye level with your townies. A not so peaceful land Farm animals such as cows, sheep, and chickens provide you with important resources to produce food. Your hunters will find rabbits and deer to stalk. You have to be careful of wild animals like wolves or bears that you encounter! Seagulls are eager to steal your catch, while above the battlefields the crows' caw and high up in the sky eagles fly free. In time you should begin to also hire soldiers to defend your realm against intruders and enemy forces! Besides different types of soldiers, you can also make use of heavy artillery: A catapult can punch sensitive gaps in the enemy’s ranks! And should you run out of boulders, remember: everything you can lay your hands on can be used as ammo! But the enemy kingdom is not the only problem your soldiers will have to face. Some islands are infested with sinister pirates who are after your precious resources! Explore islands in new ways Intuitive control of the environment helps you move about – you can literally crawl over the island or move your viewpoint as you would position your images on your smartphone. You’ll get accustomed to ruling your empire very fast. Most of the islands you visit during the campaign can be unlocked for unrestricted play in the sandbox mode. You'll be able to choose whether you want to play completely without constraints, or give yourself a bit of excitement and accept the challenges you choose. Determine the number of townies you start the game with, defeat all opponents or fight against thieving pirates – the various settings offer you enough freedom for your personal gaming experience! Story: A fully-voiced campaign and story arching over 13 islands. Simulation: Assign jobs and tasks to your villagers to build your supply chains and economy. Town-planning: Unlock more than 20 unique buildings and place them freely within your village to optimize transport routes. Apply upgrades to make them better! Upgrades: Conduct research for further upgrades of your buildings. Trading: Build a harbor to have a trader's ship and begin treasuring up riches. Experience: Brush over trees, form clouds into dangerous thunderstorms, go fishing with your bare hands and talk to your townies. Interaction: Simply carry workers or resources directly to their destination to speed up the construction of buildings and production. Fight: Recruit brave soldiers, build catapults, bows, and crossbows to protect your island from the Black Knights raiding henchmen. Tutorial: Your personal advisor Sir Clunk-a-lot will accompany you on your virtual tour of the medieval age with useful tips.

Subsurface Circular,Subsurface Circular,遇见当地人，了解行话 一名驻扎在 Subsurface Circular 的侦探调查了该市机器人工人阶级的一系列失踪事件。收集单词和短语，然后在对话谜题中使用它们，以揭开世界的秘密并确定它的未来。受经典冒险游戏和现代对话系统的启发，Bithell Games 创造了一个尊重您的时间和智力的单一会话故事。主要特点 一个成熟、精致、一人的游戏。由屡获殊荣的 Thomas Was Alone 和 Volume 团队开发。经典基于文本的冒险的图形转折。使用“焦点点”，一种独特的基于词汇的库存系统。Dan Le Sac 的原声带？综合艺术画廊，展示进入这个世界的详细作品。？可解锁的“BithellBot”，我们对开发者评论的互动式解说。常见问题 如果这个游戏“短”，有什么能阻止我在完成后获得退款呢？您正在浏览 Steam，这意味着您了解游戏的工作，并且原则上愿意为让您开心的游戏付费。我们希望在使用 Subsurface Circular 一段时间后，您会对所支付的价格感到满意。我需要玩过其他 Bithell 游戏才能享受这款游戏吗？不。Subsurface Circular 讲述了它自己自成一体的故事。为什么游戏只有英文版本？可以想象，文字冒险游戏包含数量惊人的文本，但更重要的是，在整个游戏中，我们使用英语中单词排序和双重含义的特殊怪癖来支持线程的组合和重新组合。简而言之，其他语言将不仅仅是直接的翻译：它们将需要重写和更改设计。并非不可能，但这次我们能做的要多。如果游戏证明成功，我们想重新审视这个问题。,"MEET THE LOCALS, PICK UP THE LINGO A detective stationed on the Subsurface Circular investigates a series of disappearances among the city’s robotic working class. Collect words and phrases, then use them in dialogue puzzles to uncover the world's secrets and determine its future. Inspired by classic adventure games and modern dialogue systems, Bithell Games has created a single session story which respects your time and your intelligence. Key Features A mature, polished, one-sitting game. Developed by the award-winning team behind Thomas Was Alone and Volume. A graphical twist on the classic text-based adventure.

Unlockable ‘BithellBot’, our interactive take on a developer’s commentary. FAQs If this game is ‘short’, what’s to stop me getting a refund when I’m done? You’re browsing Steam, which means you understand the work that goes into games, and are in principle up for paying for ones that entertain you. We hope that after a bit of time with Subsurface Circular, you’ll feel good about the price you paid. Do I need to have played other Bithell games to enjoy this one? No. Subsurface Circular tells its own self contained story. Why is the game only available in English? As you can imagine, a text adventure game contains a terrifying amount of text, but more importantly, throughout the game we use the particular quirks of word ordering and double meaning in English to support the combination and recombination of threads. Put simply, other languages are going to be more than a straight translation: They’re going to need rewrites and changed design. Not impossible, but more than we could get done this time around. If the game proves successful, we’d like to revisit this.","“Subsurface Circular 通过出色的写作、出色的节奏、闪亮的对话和轰动的故事节拍等令人钦佩的技巧,从有限的资源中提取出最大的娱乐。”9/10 – 多边形 “有很多曲折,以至于你永远无法完全掌握整个故事,直到它结束。”4/5 – GamesRadar “Subsurface Circular 的机器人之谜拥有一系列栩栩如生的角色,以及从头到尾引人入胜的故事,从火车离开车站的那一刻起就吸引了您的注意力。”8/10 – 电子游戏玩家","“Subsurface Circular extracts maximum entertainment from limited resources through the admirable trick of great writing, excellent pacing, sparkling dialogue and bang-on story beats.” 9/10 – Polygon “There are plenty of twists and turns to the point that you can never quite grasp the whole story until it’s closing out.” 4/5 – GamesRadar “With a cast of well-realised characters, and a story that captivates from start-to-finish, Subsurface Circular's robot mystery will have your attention from the moment the train leaves the station.” 8/10 – VideoGamer"

It is a massive 16 hour experiences with miles and miles worth of world to explore, and provided you have a powerful machine (980 and up) you can experience it with some of the most ambitious high end graphics tried in VR to date. TSP is not a pure VR game. It was designed for non-VR gameplay and thus a VR headset is in no way required to play the game. If you do have one, it is an awesome (but different) experience! VR is work in progress - Currently not implemented: VR Loading screens and Oculus Touch. The intro tutorial is also a bit rough. Everything else works solidly. TSP received a major VR patch July 20 2016 adding VR inventory and crafting among many other fixes, and another one on December 4 2016 adding the Explorer Diary and a range of fixes.

Steam Workshop gives the players a voice, allowing for the mechanics and level designs of Polyball to stretch far beyond what we had initially put into the game. With a built-in level editor easily accessible from the main menu creating content is a breeze, it even supports custom model and texture importing! A BIT ABOUT US The first full release from digital design practice Studio Monolith, Polyball is an experiment in low-poly visuals and open-ended game design. Our approach with the project was to make the kind of game we used to play, something that had both casual appeal and a limitless competitive ceiling. It was also a genre that we felt hasn't been adequately adapted to the modern world of game design. Our vision was simple: build a game that's easy to pick up, hard to master, and fun both on and off screen.

It looks promising.” Destructoid “Polyball may very well be the new standard for not only Platformers, but for early access games in terms of available content. This new indie game could become a new standard for future platformer games.” 9/10 – Keen Gamer “I do feel that Polyball has a lot to offer and despite still being in Early Access, the price is more than justifiable considering that you get a ton of content all around.

Cubotrox is an addictive puzzle game that challenges you to complete pixel art images by managing falling neon-colored cubes. Catch, drop and rotate your way to victory in a game with retro-futuristic neon visuals and synth-retro-wave music that excels at being “easy to play, hard to master”. EASY MECHANICS THAT ADD UP TO KILLER MIND-BREAKING CHALLENGES The game can be summed up in a real easy way: you have pixel art images that must be completed by managing some neon-colored cubes that are constantly appearing from all sides of the screen. You must manage these cubes to complete the image. Mechanics are rather simple: catch, drop and rotate the cubes and rotate all the screen. But as you progress you start to face increasing challenges related to the limited time, the management of the cubes, the frequency of the cubes’ fall, etc. But there’s no use on explaining this: go play the game. By minute 1 you will say “hehe, this is stupidly simple”; but by minute 20 you will be fully engaged and screaming “damn! I didn’t think of that! Let’s re-start this level AGAIN!”. Believe us: you will end admitting that Cubotrox is a masterclass on “easy to play, hard to master”. A BEAUTIFUL ENDLESS STREAM OF PIXEL ART Cubotrox’ puzzles are comprised by pixel art images that must be completed through cube management. Don’t fool ourselves: there’s an ongoing pixel art craze and we’re not trying to fight against it. We love pixel art and Cubotrox is like an interactive pixel art gallery where every piece is turned into a puzzle to be solved. And it also is a HUGE pixel art gallery: +100 levels to be played and even an endless mode (coming soon) that dares you to find your skills’ limit. Get better at Cubotrox and rotate your way to the first positions in a global world ranking for both level and endless modes. LET’S TURN GREAT INDIE GAMES INTO AWESOME PUZZLES! So we were building this kick-ass pixel art library when we realized the only way of making it really perfect was by adding some of our favorite beauties. We contacted pixel artists and gamedevs we admire to ask them for permission to add their creations to our games. It turns out to be that the indie community is freaking cool and most of them agreed almost instantly. So now we have proudly included levels based on games we love such as Nuclear Throne, Enter the Gungeon, Elliot Quest, They Bleed Pixels, Crypt of the Necrodancer, and many more! ALL ABOUT THE GAME FEEL // WHY THIS TEXT IS ALMOST USELESS Let’s be brutally honest: this text is almost useless. And why is that? Because Cubotrox is ALL bite and no bark. Damn, see the our video: it is just little cubes being rotated and dropped at seemingly simple pixel-art images. We know. All people start by being a bit skeptical with Cubotrox because of its perceived simplicity but almost all those people ends addicted to it once they start playing the game. Because Cubotrox isn’t something that you can explain in a text or even through a video: Cubotrox is a feeling you get once you start playing, when the increasing difficult challenges are mixed with the retro-futuristic neon visuals and the synth-retro-wave music. It’s a great feeling that slowly secludes you in the hypnotic world of Cubotrox. So, please, stop reading this and just start playing: you will see we’re all about game feel. FEATURES +100 levels and endless mode (coming soon) - Cubotrox is a huge pixel art gallery with tons of puzzles comprised by pixel art images that must be completed.

Mary, the owner of the Mary Co. museum, loves to collect ancient antiques, clothes, dolls, bones and utensils. Every Saturday, she goes to a nearby antique store to buy ancient stuff in order to add them to her collections in her museum. On 20th September, she went to the shop to buy an ancient cursed doll. She was a skeptic and did not believe in ghosts until she experienced the paranormal activities herself. As soon as she brought the doll to her museum the things started to take a darker turn. Her museum was on the ground floor while she lived on the fourth floor and the rest three floors were empty. But she started experiencing paranormal activities including things getting misplaced, poltergeist activities and nightmare. A few days following the incident she started researching the history behind the doll and discovered that the doll was cursed. She was desperately in search of the remedy of the situation but she came to know that the only way to stop the paranormal activities was to get rid of the doll and sending it over to its previous location where the doll was originally kept and the curse would be lifted. However, it is easier said than done. The Devil residing inside the doll will try to stop Mary from achieving her goal. Will she be able to lift the curse, placed on her? Her fate is in your hands now. Key Features: Explore the Museum for the proof of the paranormal. Demons are lurking in the shadows. Experience the poltergeist activities and nightmarish illusions. Face your fears while exploring the building and unknown locations. Nearly half an hour duration of the paranormal investigation. Note: I am a solo indie game developer and I have done all of the graphics, animation, character design, and programming except for the music. I hope you will enjoy the game.","“My Haunted Doll 是一款简单的 2D 恐怖独立游戏。探索黑暗的博物馆、一些 Jumpscare、迷你游戏和谜题来解决。它很短,但对于低要价来说已经足够有趣了。（由单人开发团队制作）“Games Without Borders","“My Haunted Doll is a simple 2d horror indie game.

illumine,illumine,Illumine 是一款 roguelike 游戏。但是，illumine 的世界并不是一个静态的程序生成的地方。在 illumine 中，玩家与环境交互，触发其动态转换。然后，每种情况都变成了一个独立的谜题，玩家可以从任何角度接近它，并随心所欲地处理，无论是通过隐身还是纵 AI。这个世界上并非所有的居民都是友好的。为了取得进展，玩家不仅要睁大眼睛，还要仔细倾听周围的环境。由于配乐是由玩家附近的各种 AI 和游戏元素实时生成的，因此音乐的任何变化都会告诉他可能潜伏在黑暗中的危险。主角最终会克服这些障碍，如果不是在今生，那么在未来的轮回中。由于前世会影响他的未来，主角与他人的互动方式将塑造他的经历。最终将取决于玩家找到自己的目标，无论是他自己的个人发展还是他人的福祉。,"Illumine is a roguelike. However, illumine's world is not a static procedurally generated place. In illumine the player interacts with the environment, triggering its dynamical transformation. Each situation then becomes a self-contained puzzle, which the player can approach from any angle and deal with however he wants, whether by stealth or by manipulating the AI. Not all inhabitants of this world are friendly. In order to progress, the player will not only have to keep his eyes open but he will also have to listen closely to his surroundings. As the soundtrack is generated in real-time by the various AI and gameplay elements in the player's vicinity, any change in the music will inform him of the dangers that might be lurking in the dark. The main character will eventually overcome these hurdles, if not in this life, then in a future reincarnation. As past lives will affect his future, how the main character interacts with others will shape his experience. It will ultimately be up to the player to find his purpose, be it his own personal development or others' well-being.","“一次个人探索,一次无尽的旅程。”Famitsu “一件带有奇异而神秘的世界观的艺术品。”电击游戏机 “作为一部关于在陌生地方孤独的感觉的艺术表达,Illumine 是一流的。”独立游戏","“A personal exploration, an endless journey.” Famitsu “A work of art that carries a strange and mysterious view of the world.” Dengeki Playstation “As a piece of artistic expression about the nature of feeling alone in a strange place, Illumine is top-notch.” Indie Games"

AegisM,AegisM,《AegisM》是一款充满竞争力、注重平衡性与数值深度的塔防游戏，其独特之处在于将塔防与波次生存 / 俯视视角动作射击相结合，并融入更多新鲜刺激的元素。玩家可独自作战或与他人组队，制定最佳策略，在永无止境的生存排行榜上冲击最高分。《AegisM》不同于其他塔防游戏：没有固定的敌人波次，挑战永不停歇且难度逐渐攀升，直至你无法生存、策略失效。玩家可按自己的方式建造防御塔，每个基于投射物的防御塔属性均可调整，在每级塔的升级中提升射程、伤害、射速、暴击率和暴击伤害，大幅拓展可采用的策略数量！防御塔还能进化 —— 游戏中不仅有 34 种防御塔，还可将其进化为不同形态，例如将火箭塔转换为核弹塔、牺牲金币生成器来治疗基地、让塔对特定敌人类型产生抗性等，这使塔的总数增至 68 种，进一步丰富战术选择！随着游戏推进和生存时间延长，会遇到新的 Boss，每个 Boss 都有独特能力，如加速、护盾、 Skull 干扰等。此外，玩家不仅要担心地面敌人，还有多种空中单位需要击败！每局游戏开始时，玩家可花费技能点打造独特角色，每击杀 1000 个敌人可获得额外技能点，用于提升移动速度、减少换弹时间、降低建造成本或增加弹匣容量，围绕自己的玩法风格构建角色。游戏中可赚取经验、提升等级，解锁新角色、魔法能力和技能，助力击败无穷无尽的敌群！游戏内会显示成就进度，让玩家清楚距离解锁目标角色还有多远。通过 -m.com 的新网络服务，玩家可了解每局尝试的详细数据，每局结束后会获得唯一链接打开统计页面，深入分析所有数据（例如可查看此局游戏：-m.com/lobby/109775240977948255/）。若想对其他玩家隐藏数据，可在开始前将其标记为私有，该网络服务会持续优化，每次访问都能看到更多统计信息。目前有 12 种不同类型的防御塔，每种有 3 级和替代模式（进化），只需点击即可查看每个塔的属性、所属玩家、射程以及升级后的变化，还可配置快捷键加快建造、升级和进化速度。通过经验解锁角色能力后，可选择多种辅助战斗的能力，包括减速穹顶、传送器、冲刺、屏障、暴击率提升和金币收集器。通过经验解锁魔法能力后，可选择多种与角色定制和能力互补的魔法力量，包括魔像重击、冰封锁、基地治疗、角色狂暴和防御塔伤害提升。游戏中有动态天气的多重环境，可在森林、沙漠甚至地下墓穴等室内场景作战，完整的昼夜循环（仅影响视觉效果）搭配风雨雷电，让战斗世界栩栩如生！还有电梯、动态变化的关卡和火焰墙等互动元素，增添更多变化。游戏内供应商提供多种武器选择：若不喜欢塔防，想尝试混合策略或单纯享受射击，可使用金币购买武器而非建造防御塔，有手枪、步枪、霰弹枪、激光枪、轨道炮、火焰喷射器和剑可供使用，更别忘了可购买手榴弹、地雷和空袭支援！游戏具有极高的重玩价值和丰富策略，已有玩家投入数百小时研究最佳策略，因此首次尝试未进入前十也不必气馁。《AegisM》拥有全球排行榜，竞争激烈，随着游玩次数增加，玩家会逐渐明白如何延长生存时间：是只建造防御塔，还是塔防与枪械混合，亦或只使用枪械？何时升级或进化防御塔？是升级属性还是提升塔的基础等级？查看 Steam 评论中的平均游玩时间便可知晓！此外还有不断增加的竞争性迷你游戏，从射击到迷宫和限时类游戏不等，每个迷你游戏都有竞争排行榜，玩家甚至能向世界展示自己是最快的建造者或奔跑者。游戏经过 8 年多开发，数百名玩家提供反馈，多年来不断完善平衡性、随时间变化的数值缩放和成本调整，确保没有单一策略能长期有效，例如仅放置一座塔或只购买一把枪，仅凭弓箭塔或步枪无法长久生存！,"AegisM is a competitive, balanced and stat heavy tower defence game with a twist. It combines tower defence with a wave survival/top down action shooter and then adds more new and exciting elements to the mix. Work alone or team up with others to work out the best strategy to achieve the highest scores on the never ending survival leaderboards. AegisM is unlike other tower defence games; there are no waves of enemies, it's never ending, gradually getting harder and harder until you can't survive anymore and your strategy fails you. Build towers your way You can change all of the stats on each of your projectile based towers. Upgrade range, damage, rate, critical chance and critical damage at every tower level to expand massively on the amount of strategies available to you! Evolve Towers Not only are there 34 towers in the game, but you can now evolve your towers into something different. Convert rocket towers into nuke towers, sacrifice coin generators to heal your base, make your towers resistant to certain enemy types and much more! This increases the total tower count to 68 and increases the available tactics to you! Unique Bosses As the game progresses and you last longer, you get introduced to new bosses. Each boss has a unique ability such as speed boosting, protecting, skull distracting and much more. Did we mention you don't just have to worry about land? There's also various types of air units to beat! Skill Points At the start of every game you get to spend a skill point on making your character unique. Every 1000 kills you gain another point to place into movement speed, reduced reload speed, build cost reduction or magazine size! Build a character around your style of play. Achievements and Unlockables Earn experience, gain levels, unlock new characters, magical powers and abilities that help you defeat the never ending horde of enemies! Achievement progress is displayed in game so you can see how far off you are from unlocking the character you want. Statistics Help understand what happened on each of your attempts on our new web service at -m.com . At the end of every game you play, you'll be given a unique link to open the statistics page and drill down into all the numbers possible. As an example, you can view a game here: -m.com/lobby/109775240977948255/ . Don't worry, if you want to hide your statistics from other players, there's the option to mark them as private before you start! This web service is constantly improving over time, so expect more stats each time you visit there. Multiple Towers, each with 3 levels There's currently 12 different types of tower, each with 3 levels and an alternative mode (evolve). See the stats for every tower, which player owns it, what the range of the tower is and what will happen if you upgrade it, simply by clicking it. You can also configure shortcut keys to speed build, upgrade and evolve. Character Abilities Once unlocked through experience, you can select from various abilities that help aid your fight. These include slow dome, teleporter, dash, barriers, critical chance and a coin collector. Magical Powers Once unlocked through experience, you can select from various magical powers that compliment abilities and your character customisation. These include golem smash, ice block, heal base, character rage and a tower damage boost. Multiple Environments with Dynamic Weather Fight it out in the Forest, Desert or even indoors in the crypts! There's a full day and night cycle (this only affects the game visually), along with rain and thunder - the world you're fighting in feels alive! There's also interactive elements such as lifts, dynamically changing levels and flame walls to add yet more variety. Vendor with a huge selection of weapons Don't like tower defence, want a hybrid strategy, or just simply enjoy shooting? Use your coins to buy weapons instead of towers and do the shooting yourself! There's a pistol, rifle, shotgun, laser, railgun, flame thrower and a sword to use. Lets not forget to mention the grenades, mines and air strikes that you can purchase! Incredible replay-ability and a huge range of strategies We have players who have put 100's (yes, 100's) of hours into working out the best strategies so don't be put off if you don't score top 10 on your first go. AegisM is incredibly competitive with worldwide leaderboards. As you play more and more, you start working out what you need to do to survive longer. Will you build towers only or go hybrid with guns? Will you shoot guns only? When will you upgrade or evolve that tower? Will you upgrade the stats or upgrade the base level of a tower? Look at the average play time of our Steam reviews and you'll see what we mean! Mini Games There is an ever growing list of competitive mini games that range from shooters to maze and timed type of games. Each mini game has a competitive leaderboard, so you can even show the world you're the fastest builder or runner out there. Completely Balanced The game has been in development for over 8 years with 100's of players giving us feedback. We have spent years perfecting the balance, how things scale over time and changing costs to ensure that there are no silly strategies such as only placing one tower or only buying one gun. You can only last so long with that arrow tower or rifle!","“AegisM 是一款很容易上手的游戏,但随着海浪的加剧和敌人的强大,它在快速、扩展的游戏玩法中变得令人上瘾！”BigBossBattle “激烈但令人上瘾的塔防” ETNL","“AegisM is a pretty easy game to start, but as the waves ramp up and enemies get stronger, it becomes simply addictive in its rapid, scaling gameplay!” BigBossBattle “Intense But Addictive Tower Defence” ETNL"

The game has drawn inspiration from classics such as Close Combat, Steel Panthers and Flashpoint Campaigns: Red Storm. In Armored Brigade the Cold War has turned hot, and Europe is once again torn apart by conflict. An 'Iron Curtain' divides the Western Powers gathered together under the NATO banner from the Soviet Union and its Warsaw Pact Allies. Take command of the deadliest mechanized formations available during an arc of time spanning from the Kennedy-Chru?cev confrontation to the final years, and fight your opponents in large and detailed maps all across Europe. Large maps, modelled upon real terrain make each battle a true test of wits. Weather and visibility all play a role and with several munition types, including air to air combat and artillery, no battle will be the same. Exciting and challenging tank warfare only adds to the level of realism.","“《装甲旅》充满了兵棋推演的优点,其中最主要的是可以使用它们的种类繁多的单位和环境,其次是围绕自主和相对自给自足的单位编队订购的乐趣。”Wargamer “Armored Brigade 是一款出色的战术策略游戏,具有独特的战斗生成器,可确保巨大的重玩价值,以及可管理的机制和可靠的 AI”Out of Eight“Armored Brigade 是迄今为止我玩过的最好的冷战转为热门战争游戏”大 Boss 战","“Armored Brigade is overflowing with wargaming goodness, chief of which is the huge assortment of units and environments to use them in, followed by the joy of ordering around formations of autonomous and relatively self-sufficient units.” Wargamer “Armored Brigade is a fantastic tactical strategy game with a unique battle generator that ensures huge replay value, along with manageable mechanics and solid AI” Out of Eight “Armored Brigade is by far the best Cold-War-turned-Hot wargame I’ve ever played” Big Boss Battle"
议会,The Council,The Council 完整赛季允许您访问所有 5 集。The Council 是一款与众不同的情节游戏。为叙事冒险提供全新的体验，您的选择和角色成长真的很重要。做出艰难的决定，但也要培养一系列技能来直接影响故事的展开。有了永久、持久的后果，就没有回头路了。以经典谋杀之谜的风格投入到一个充满阴谋和纵的故事中，与一群迷人的角色一起生活，每个角色都隐藏着自己的黑暗秘密。在揭开可怕的真相时，不要相信任何人 - 无论身心付出多大的代价。The Council 始于 1793 年，玩家在神秘的莫蒂默勋爵 （Lord Mortimer） 邀请他前往英格兰海岸附近的一个私人岛屿后，扮演秘密社团成员 Louis de Richet。与他同行的还有许多知名嘉宾，包括拿破仑·波拿巴和新成立的美利坚合众国总统乔治·华盛顿。这场私人招待会的奇怪性质不仅仅局限于尊贵的客人——Richet 的母亲最近在岛上失踪了，而每一位形形色色的演员似乎都有自己隐藏的议程。在该类型的新转折中，The Council 游戏玩法的核心来自于使用独特的 Social Influence 系统在角色遭遇中纵和纵。在对抗中，可以使用技能和有限的资源来占据上风并达到预期的结果。玩家将根据他们对每个角色的心理脆弱性和免疫力的了解，以及他们在之前的探索和调查中所做的准备而获得奖励。遭遇战失败并不意味着“游戏结束”，并且无法采取任何行动。后果是永久性的，并可能导致持续的身体毁容或心理特征，从而帮助或阻碍玩家的其余冒险。Richet 的众多技能可以发展以与您选择的冒险方法保持一致。通过外交解决问题，深入研究神秘学以扩展您的历史和科学知识，或者扮演侦探，看看其他人没有感知到的东西。您的技能将远远超出您与其他客人的对话。拥有 15 种不同的技能可供使用和投资，玩家可以自由地以他们认为合适的方式揭开 The Council 的谜团，根据他们的方法，后果会大相径庭。结果将永远改变 Louis de Richet 和他周围人的生活，并塑造我们所知道的历史。,"The Complete Season of The Council grants you access to all 5 episodes. The Council is an episodic game like no other. Delivering a fresh new take on the Narrative Adventure, your choices and character growth truly matter. Make hard-hitting decisions, but also develop an array of skills to directly impact how the story unfolds. With permanent, long-lasting consequences, there is no going back. Plunge into a tale of intrigue and manipulation in the style of a classic murder mystery, living with a cast of alluring characters each hiding their own dark secrets. Trust no one while uncovering dire truths – no matter the cost to mind and body. The Council begins in 1793, with players taking the role of secret society member Louis de Richet after his invitation to a private island off the shores of England by the enigmatic Lord Mortimer. Joining him are a number of high profile guests, including Napoleon Bonaparte and President of the newly-formed United States of America, George Washington. The strange nature of this private reception goes beyond just the prestigious guests –Richet’s own mother has recently gone missing on the island, while each and every one of the colorful cast seems to have their own hidden agendas. In a new twist for the genre, the core of The Council’s gameplay comes from manipulating and maneuvering through character encounters using the unique Social Influence system. During confrontations, skills and limited resources can be used to gain the upper hand and achieve the desired outcome. Players will be rewarded for their knowledge of each character’s psychological vulnerabilities and immunities, as well as their preparations made during prior exploration and investigation. Failing an encounter does not mean ‘game over’, and no action can be taken back. The consequences are permanent, and may result in persistent physical disfigurements or mental traits that help or hinder the rest of the player’s adventure. Richet’s numerous skills can be developed to align with your chosen approach to the adventure. Solve issues with diplomacy, delve into occultism to expand your historical and scientific knowledge, or play detective and see what others do not perceive. Your skills will have uses that extend far beyond your conversations with fellow guests. With 15 diverse skills to use and invest in, players are free to uncover The Council’s mysteries how they see fit, with wildly varying consequences depending on their methods. The results will forever alter the life of Louis de Richet, of those around him, and shape history as we know it.","“冒险游戏的新时代” 9/10 – 游戏革命 “我被这个故事迷住了,我真的需要知道接下来会发生什么！”15/20 – Jeuxvideo com “RPG 机制真正提升了体验” 8/10 – GameReactor","“An adventure gamer's delight.” 9/10 – IGN “Everything I wanted and more.” 9/10 – The Gamer “A nostalgic, swashbuckling adventure you won’t want to miss.” 9/10 – GamesRadar"

Dofus,Dofus,《Dofus》 是一个等待被发现的广阔世界！踏入十二世界，探索其广阔而肥沃的景观、阴郁的沼泽地以及众多宝藏。这些城市是商业（和犯罪）活动的繁华中心……野生动物壮观，水源纯净，空气清新而锐利，土地是你见过的最肥沃的……但在田园诗般的背后，阴影和陷阱潜伏着……其边界仍然不明确，新的地区一直在被发现……尤其是自从神之维度——神的世界——向勇敢的冒险者开放以来。战斗是一门艺术。不要盲目冲锋，而是要仔细思考你的战术计划。它们是按回合进行的：你先进行你的行动，然后观察其他玩家和怪物的行动。组成一个最多8人的团队，攻击最凶猛的怪物！你是在寻找任务吗？那么什么是多夫斯呢？它是龙蛋！我们真正感兴趣的是六种原始多夫斯：祖母绿、赭色、绿松石、深红色、象牙色和乌木色。它们隐藏在十二世界的各个角落。传说中，谁能收集到全部六个，谁就会变得像神一样强大。那么，你准备开始寻找了吗？所有工作都值得报酬！哪里有职业，哪里就有工作。“什么？！在电子游戏中工作？”但别忘了，哪里有工作，哪里就有报酬！努力工作，你将获得大量的卡玛！听起来更有吸引力了？《多夫斯》提供了18种职业，可以制作从简单的面包到复杂的高级帽子、披风、腰带、靴子、戒指、护身符或武器。你甚至可以用锻造魔法职业来提升现有装备。你并不孤单！《多夫斯》给你机会与十二世界中的每个人交流。分享、密谋、提供建议……当然，要保持友好和礼貌！不要害羞：打破僵局，无论是通过一起对抗怪物、探索地牢、讨论波沃夫为什么这么毛茸茸，还是仅仅分享你最棒的冒险故事！你甚至可以通过成立（或加入）公会来组建一个持久的团队。无论你是朋友的一群、雇佣兵的一个营，还是热爱竹奶的熊猫瓦斯协会，总有理由聚在一起！我今晚不能出去，我有《多夫斯》的事情要做！除了其令人兴奋的世界外，《多夫斯》还有一个特殊的日历。每个月都有自己的守护者，他或她将自己的性格和愿望强加于这个月及其天气。至于日子，则由“梅里迪亚”来照顾，这些小神都有自己的主题和力量。由于他们的梅里迪亚效应，十二世界中的每一天都有所不同……你喜欢什么？寻宝猎人、无所畏惧（且头脑简单的）战士、伏都娃娃的召唤者……你将有很多选择。在可供选择的18种职业中，有些更适合近战，有些更喜欢远程攻击，还有一些则专注于治疗和保护。选择权在你手中……,"A VAST WORLD JUST WAITING TO BE DISCOVERED! Step into the World of Twelve and explore its vast, lush landscapes, its gloomy moors and its many treasures. Its cities are bustling centres of commercial (and criminal) activity... The wildlife is magnificent, the water is pure, the air is fresh and sharp, and the earth is the most fertile you've ever seen... But behind the idyll, shadows and traps lurk... Its boundaries are still unclear, and new areas are being discovered all the time... especially since the Divine Dimensions, the worlds of the gods, opened up to brave adventurers. Fighting is an art. Rather than rushing in headlong, think hard about your tactical game plan. They work on a turn-by-turn basis: you take your turn to perform your actions, then observe those of the other players and monsters. Form a group of up to 8 players and attack the meanest monsters around! Are you on a quest for quests?: So what IS a Dofus? It's a dragon's egg! They exist in various shapes, sizes and colours. The ones we're really interested in are the six Primordial Dofus: Emerald, Ochre, Turquoise, Crimson, Ivory and Ebony. They are hidden, scattered all around the World of Twelve. Legend has it that the one who manages to gather all six will become as powerful as a god. So, what do you say? Ready to start searching? All work deserves payment!: Where there are professions, there is work. 'What?! Work, in a video game?' But don't forget that where there is work, there is pay! Work hard and you'll earn kamas in spades! Sound more appealing now? DOFUS offers 18 professions that can craft something as simple as a loaf of bread or something as complex as high-level hats, capes, belts, boots, rings, amulets, or weapons. You can even improve existing gear with the smithmaging professions. You're not alone! DOFUS gives you the chance to communicate with everyone in the World of Twelve. Share, conspire, offer advice... whilst remaining friendly and polite, of course! Don't be shy: break the ice, whether it's by facing a monster together, exploring a dungeon, discussing why Boowolves are so hairy, or simply sharing your best adventure stories! You can even put together a lasting team by founding (or joining) a guild. Whether you're part of a band of friends, a batallion of mercenaries or an association of Pandawas who love their Bamboo Milk, there's always a reason to get together! I can't hang out tonight, I have DOFUS stuff to do![/b]: As well as its exciting world, DOFUS has a special calendar. Each month has its own protector, who imposes his or her character and wishes on the month and its weather. As for the days, they are taken care of by 'Meridia', minor gods with their own themes and powers. Thanks to their Meridian Effects, each day in the World of Twelve is a little different... Whatever you like! Treasure hunter, fearless (and brainless) warrior, summoner of voodoo dolls... you'll be spoilt for choice. Of the 18 classes to choose from, some are more suited to close combat and some prefer to attack from afar, whilst others still focus on healing and protecting. The choice is yours...","“我更喜欢 Dofus 对传统 MMORPG 游戏的有趣方法,而不是 Wakfu 的开放式沙盒和社交功能,这说明了很多。”8.1/10 – MMORPG “如果你喜欢轻松创建超级角色并喜欢杀死无知的菜鸟,那么 Dofus 可能不适合你。但是,如果你想要一些有点另类的东西,严重依赖社区和团体目标,你可以做的比花 7 美元看看你是否喜欢它差得多。8.4/10 – MYGAMER “尽管 Dofus 很古怪,但对于那些在 MMO 中寻找不同事物的人来说,Dofus 仍然是一个坚实且偶尔出色的提议。”8/10 – 欧洲游戏玩家","“I like Dofus' fun approach to traditional MMORPG gameplay even more than Wakfu's open-ended sandbox and social features, which is saying a lot.” 8.1/10 – MMORPG “If you like to easily create uber-characters and enjoy killing clueless noobs, Dofus probably isn't the game for you. But, if you want something that's a little offbeat, with a heavy reliance on community and group goals, you can do a lot worse than spending $7 to see if you like it.” 8.4/10 – MYGAMER “Despite its eccentricities, Dofus remains a solid and occasionally brilliant proposition for those looking for something different in an MMO.” 8/10 – EUROGAMER"

You are Watcher. You dutifully fulfil your purpose in service of the ALLMOTHER, until the day you learn a shocking secret that changes everything. In the near future we learn we are not alone in the universe. A mysterious alien race of giant entities arrives. We call them the Occupants. They are not hostile, but it doesn’t matter. Their arrival is a death sentence. Humanity is wiped out in a matter of months, succumbing to a disease the Occupants have brought to our planet. There is one survivor, a teenage girl called Iris. Somehow she is immune. 1000 years later. Iris is not only immune but immortal. She has birthed a new society consisting exclusively of her own clones. She calls them Sisters. They call her the ALLMOTHER. Unlike the ALLMOTHER, the sisters are not immune. They must wear masks 24/7 to avoid breathing the diseased air even in the Orchard - an underground bunker where they live in constant fear of an Occupant attack. The ALLMOTHER lives in her own compound on the front line of the war with the Occupants. All Sisters dream of one day being able to take the train and join her in the fight. Within the Orchard, every sister has an assigned function, while six sisters have special roles to play… Principal - Head of administration and oversight of the Orchard Bang Bang Fire - Head of military Knower - Head of knowledge preservation Fixer - Head of engineering Healer - Head of medical and cloning And you - the new Watcher . Your role is unique. You have the great privilege of reliving and interpreting the memories of the ALLMOTHER through a process known as Communion, made possible by Secretary, your floating AI companion. As the game begins, you are excited to embark on your first Communion. But all is not well. Your closest sister, Fixer, comes to you with a dangerous revelation. You have been lied to. The ALLMOTHER is not what she claims to be. Fixer’s claims rock the foundations of your world, throwing everything you know and believe into doubt. After Fixer is executed for her treason, it falls to you to discover the truth. Dive into the memories of the ALLMOTHER. Explore pivotal moments in her life from high school days and the arrival of the Occupants to the creation of the Orchard and the birth of the first sisters. Jump back and forth through moments in time within these memories to solve puzzles and access locked off areas and secrets. In between Communions, explore the Orchard - a large underground hub area which houses you and your sisters, has many characters to speak to, and holds many things to uncover. Find the truth and reclaim your legacy. Experience perspective shifts both literal and metaphorical as the game blends between 3rd person adventure, visual novel and first person walking simulator while throwing twists, turns and revelations at you until you question everything you think you know.

As our existence expanded, crime became harder and harder to control in the vast reaches of space. As a result, laws became more strict. Government attempts to wrangle the issue bolstered a growing police force and, over many years, the reach of law enforcement grew larger and more aggressive. The general population, simply wanting to feel safe, grew more accepting and the first fully commercially run prison systems took form. Nearly one hundred years later, in 2290 imprisonment is commonplace. A blind trust has been placed in the commercial justice system eventually landing everyday people in jail for years for even the smallest offenses creating a massive divide between the idea of prisoner and person. Hundreds of commercial prisons and law enforcement companies thrive. Devaluing of prisoner lives and massive prison overpopulation gave birth to an auction system where anyone could purchase prisoners for any use free of legal ramifications. Acquired in the most recent bulk order of prisoners for BioMass Labs, you are being shuttled off for study at the Kohate testing facilities. No information is known about the details of the study. You have been black-bagged, loaded onto a transport shuttle, and are waiting for law enforcement to release you to the company. THE GAME The subject is a sci-fi puzzle game designed to combine a mix of classic puzzle adventure games with horror elements and visual aesthetics of early 80s sci-fi. You will need to learn to navigate the complex to find your way to the various testing rooms set out in the experiment and collect items needed to progress through the maze. You are being monitored by those running the tests and are required to visit a bio-data terminal periodically to record your vital signs and other data for record keeping. If you fail to do so, you will be removed from testing by euthanization.","“Brian Clarke 拥有 3A 级的价值观和有趣的恐怖故事,在《The Subject》发行后,独立电影界应该开始关注这个名字。”独立游戏网站 “The Subject 的气氛令人愉悦地压抑和鲜明” 4.5/5 – 聋麻雀","“With triple-A values to look out for and a more than interesting horror tale to experience, Brian Clarke could be a name the indie scene should start looking out for after the release of The Subject.” The Indie Game Website “The atmosphere of The Subject is pleasingly oppressive and stark” 4.5/5 – Deaf Sparrow"

秃鹰：黑客特别版,Vulture for NetHack,《NetHack》是一款经典的Roguelike角色扮演游戏，以其极简ASCII图形、极高自由度和深度系统闻名。你将踏入“威胁迷宫”（Mazes of Menace），在随机生成的地下城中冒险、战斗、拾取道具，目标是寻找传说中的“延多尔护身符”（Amulet of Yendor）——一件据说能赋予不朽之力的神秘宝物。,"NetHack Nethack is the most celebrated member of the ancient and honorable family of games descended from Rogue and hence known as “roguelike”: bare-bones ASCII-graphics adventures set in randomly generated dungeons, in which the player fights monsters and collects items until he or she dies. Vulture Vulture for NetHack in an isometric graphical interface for the roguelike engine: NetHack. Wrapping the original ASCII text dungeons of NetHack, Vulture brings this great game into the graphical point and click world while still preserving the original keyboard commands for those wishing to play as it was intended. The adventure Recently, you have begun to find yourself unfulfilled and distant in your daily occupation. Strange dreams of prospecting, stealing, crusading, and combat have haunted you in your sleep for many months, but you aren't sure of the reason. You wonder whether you have in fact been having those dreams all your life, and somehow managed to forget about them until now. Some nights you awaken suddenly and cry out, terrified at the vivid recollection of the strange and powerful creatures that seem to be lurking behind every corner of the dungeon in your dream. Could these details haunting your dreams be real? As each night passes, you feel the desire to enter the mysterious caverns near the ruins grow stronger. Each morning, however, you quickly put the idea out of your head as you recall the tales of those who entered the caverns before you and did not return. Eventually you can resist the yearning to seek out the fantastic place in your dreams no longer. After all, when other adventurers came back this way after spending time in the caverns, they usually seemed better off than when they passed through the first time. And who was to say that all of those who did not return had not just kept going? Asking around, you hear about a bauble, called the Amulet of Yendor by some, which, if you can find it, will bring you great wealth. One legend you were told even mentioned that the one who finds the amulet will be granted immortality by the gods. The amulet is rumored to be somewhere beyond the Valley of Gehennom, deep within the Mazes of Menace. Upon hearing the legends, you immediately realize that there is some profound and undiscovered reason that you are to descend into the caverns and seek out that amulet of which they spoke. Even if the rumors of the amulet's powers are untrue, you decide that you should at least be able to sell the tales of your adventures to the local minstrels for a tidy sum, especially if you encounter any of the terrifying and magical creatures of your dreams along the way. You spend one last night fortifying yourself at the local inn, becoming more and more depressed as you watch the odds of your success being posted on the inn's walls getting lower and lower. In the morning you awake, collect your belongings, and set off for the dungeon. After several days of uneventful travel, you see the ancient ruins that mark the entrance to the Mazes of Menace. It is late at night, so you make camp at the entrance and spend the night sleeping under the open skies. In the morning, you gather your gear, eat what may be your last meal outside, and enter the dungeon...","“太棒了！在棍子上!!!”10/10 – stinkytaco “我花在玩上古卷轴系列的时间加起来更少了。这个游戏令人上瘾,令人沮丧,并且没有随着年龄的增长而失去任何东西。深入地牢,在随机生成的关卡中与一千种不同的怪物战斗,完成史诗般的任务。我喜欢这个游戏。10/10 – Lokisana “我是 nethack 的忠实粉丝,这使得复杂的游戏更加用户友好。图形很不错,不用记住所有复杂的键盘命令真是太好了。10/10 – Courtjester235","“awesomeness! on a stick!!!!” 10/10 – stinkytaco “I have spent less time playing the Elder Scrolls series combined.

德克医生的疯狂感染,The Infectious Madness of Doctor Dekker,《The Infectious Madness of Doctor Dekker》是一款心理悬疑类的全动态影像（FMV）游戏。你将扮演一位精神科医生，在为已故Dr. Dekker的奇异病人进行心理治疗的同时，调查他的死亡真相。玩家可自由输入问题与病人交流，影响故事发展和多重结局。游戏包含1600多段真人视频片段，支持文本问答、建议提问、多个支线故事和结局，是一场融合心理惊悚与克苏鲁风格的沉浸式推理体验。仅推荐成人玩家。,"YOU are a psychiatrist, trying to solve a murder whilst treating the unusual patients of the recently deceased Doctor Dekker - but nothing is as it seems. Type any question - and your patients will reply in full screen video. They'll have questions for you too but be careful what you say. Your words will determine their eventual fates, and your own! MAIN FEATURES FMV! - 1600+ full screen HD video responses FREE TEXT INPUT - Ask whatever you want, type questions, phrases or just keywords. SUGGESTED QUESTIONS - No keyboard? No problem. Pick from our suggested list. MULTIPLE ENDINGS - Find out whodunit, and what happens to you and your patients... MULTIPLE STORIES - 6 main suspects and 5 side-quests inc. John Guilor ( Contradiction ) RANDOM MURDERER - Chosen at the start of the game to combat spoilers SIMPLE UI - View evidence, make notes, watch replays, see your question history ACHIEVEMENTS - Steam achievements and a dynamic descriptive rating system GUINNESS WORLD RECORD - for 'The most Full Motion Video (FMV) in a videogame' WARNING - This game contains mature themes and psychological horror (including sexual themes, violence and suicide) and by its very nature is open to wide interpretation - so although not originally intended, some topics such as rape and parricide can also be inferred. Recommended for adults only. FULL DETAILS The Infectious Madness of Doctor Dekker is a Lovecraftian FMV murder mystery, which gives players full freedom to question suspects by typing their own questions instead of picking them from a predetermined list. There are no point and click puzzles to solve, just questions to ask and evidence to inspect. Finding out who killed Dr Dekker is only one part of the puzzle; working out how to fix the chaos he left behind will be so much trickier… As well as providing clues to the murder, each patient has their own bizarre problem they need your help with – from time manipulation and re-animated loved ones to horrors under the sea. Complete with an atmospheric soundtrack, The Infectious Madness of Doctor Dekker invites you to explore the shadow reality that your patients inhabit – a world full of paranormal strangeness and horrors that go bump in your head, where all you have to rely on is your own mind. Just try not to lose it... From the developers and creators of 'Murderous Muses', 'Dark Nights with Poe and Munro' and 'The Shapeshifting Detective'. CREDITS You.............................The Doctor Aislinn De’Ath..................Marianna Bianca Beckles-Rose........Jaya Dom Lister......................Nathan Helen Jenkinson..............Elin Helga Ragnars................Claire Millin Thomas..................Bryce Mark Kitto.......................Professor Alderby and guest starring John Guilor as Professor Warwick. Additional patients played by ... Carolyn English, Catherine Stacey, John Shields and Rosie Hefferon. Directed by Tim Cowles. Note : Steam overlay is only available on the Windows platform for this game. FAQ How do you progress through the game? You play through a series of five therapy sessions. Each session you'll talk to several patients, and traffic lights tell you which patients you've unlocked so you can move on. Yellow is unlocked, but you can keep talking to reach green and find all their possible responses. On the final accusation screen you choose whodunit and if you've picked correctly the game finishes and plays your ending videos. Automatic saves mean there's no way to rollback something you've said to a patient, so be careful with that. That's it in a nutshell, but we can't tell you everything, or there'd be no surprises... What happens if I ask a question they don't have an answer for? As long-time fans of FMV games and point-and-click adventures, we're all-too familiar with the 'That's not gonna work' or 'I think I'll have to try that again' phrases repeated over and over. That's why we've given the patients lots of different ways of saying 'I don't know' - most have over 40 in fact, including some that contain clues that lead you to new storylines. Is this game an AI simulator? No. A lot of the time you might get 'don't know' answers to your questions, because there are only 1600+ actual filmed responses in the game. Listen to what patients say and follow their lines of conversation to stay on track. Responses are keyword based, so literally typing words patients have already used will do half the job for you. How many acts are there? There are five acts in total. Each act is a self-contained episode, so it's possible to ask questions (and get responses) in any order to reveal the story. Some decisions you make will affect future acts, so once you hit the continue button there's no going back! What if I get stuck? We've tried to design the game so you don't get stuck, but if you do, just type 'Hint'. Think of it as asking for advice, and you'll need a lot of it if you're trying to find every response (aka going green). Make sure you've properly watched the help video too. The new 'suggested questions' list also gets you to the finish line without having to type anything. If the murderer is chosen at random, does that mean it's replayable? The game can be replayed, but it wasn't designed with that in mind. We wanted everyone to be able to experience as much of the game as possible without needing multiple plays, so branching generally removes just a few responses at a time. That said, you will have to replay the game if you want to find *all* the videos and unlock all the achievements and endings.","“Dekker 博士的感染性疯狂慢慢潜入,但一旦它被抓住,它就会把你拖到底部,让你留在那里。”Kotaku “非凡的表演和故事情节。”9/10 – 第六轴 “D'Avekki Studios 在他们的洛夫克拉夫特式谋杀之谜 The Infectious Madness of Dr. Dekker 中做得非常正确。”8/10 – 科技猛禽","“The Infectious Madness of Doctor Dekker creeps in slowly, but once it’s latched on, it drags you to the bottom and keeps you there.” Kotaku “Phenomenal acting and storyline.” 9/10 – The Sixth Axis “D'Avekki Studios got it very right in their Lovecraftian murder mystery The Infectious Madness of Dr. Dekker.” 8/10 – Techraptor"

Each day you construct your defenses, train troops, and prepare for attack. When enemies come in the night, you defend with towers, troops, and heroes with powerful abilities! Save as many towns as you can, while you travel through the Vale. Choose wisely, because each town unlocks unique assets and a hero to aid in future battles. Defeat is not the end in Valeguard. Each play you can unlock more heroes and discover new strategies to achieve victory! Build in the day and defend at night The quiet hamlets of the Vale stand defenseless. As the ValeGuard you act as mayor, merchant, and general for each village. Balance your workforce to provide food, housing, troops, and fortifications. When enemies threaten your villages, take on the role of commander with pause-able, real-time combat. Gather resources, craft weapons, and train troops Juggling resources is key to success in ValeGuard. Wood and iron are required to craft weapons. These weapons are then used to create troops or towers. Trade with merchants and buy items on the black market Gold is the most valuable of all resources and cannot be mined. Trade wisely and spend your gold carefully to ensure you have the funds you need. Random events and levels make each play unique Pumpkin patches, graveyards, wizard towers, and other town features can alter the way a town is managed and defended. Navigating nightly events can mean avoiding a deadly fight, or acquiring a magical item. Sometimes risk pays off while other times caution is wisest. Hop from town to town as you travel across the map of the Vale Each town provides a new hero, technology, and bump to starting resources.

The Indifferent Wonder of an Edible Place,The Indifferent Wonder of an Edible Place,The Indifferent Wonder of an Edible Place 是一个简短的互动故事，讲述了一个吃楼的人吃掉了 Matsyapura 镇边缘的一座塔。通过混合描述性文字和超现实主义视觉效果，我们试图思考擦除的暴力和不得不在历史边缘生存的深刻悲痛。1960 年，当孟买邦像鸡蛋一样在西高止山脉的锯齿状边缘分裂并形成古吉拉特邦和马哈拉施特拉邦的领土时，马齐亚普拉镇被政府法令遗弃——以便更容易在新邦之间划定干净的边界。传说中的古吉拉特诗人米尔·奥马尔·哈桑 （Mir UmarHassan） 哀叹这种对古镇的蓄意和暴力抹杀，并在一首题为《马齐亚普尔的建筑吞噬者》的令人愉快的讽刺诗中写道，一个地方的乏味消费和创造的民众没有他们个人和慷慨的过去的味道。最近，我们怀着对阿约提亚巴布里清真寺被拆除的恐怖的回忆，并声援反对我国政府严厉行动的抗议活动，我们重新审视了奥马尔·哈桑的原诗。在莱斯特凤凰城的支持下创建。该游戏的特定地点变体在莱斯特凤凰城展出。以及芝加哥的 Video Game Art Gallery。,"The Indifferent Wonder of an Edible Place is a short, interactive tale about a building eater consuming a tower on the edge of the town of Matsyapura. Using a blend of descriptive text and surrealist visuals it is our attempt to ponder the violence of erasure and the profound grief of having to survive on the margins of history. In 1960 when the state of Bombay split like an egg on the jagged edge of the Western Ghats and formed the territories of Gujarat and Maharashtra, the town of Matsyapura was abandoned by government decree - to make it easier to draw a clean border between the new states. Mir UmarHassan, the fabled Gujarati poet, lamented this willful and violent erasure of an ancient town and in a delightful satirical poem titled : The Building Eaters of Matsyapur, he wrote about the vapid consumption of a place and the creation of a populace that is devoid of the flavors of their individual and munificent past. With recent cause to recollect the horror of the demolition of Babri Masjid in Ayodhya, and in solidarity with the protests against the draconian actions of our government - we are revisiting UmarHassan's original poem. Created with support from Phoenix, Leicester. A site-specific variant of the game was displayed at Phoenix, Leicester.

再见 德波尼亚,Goodbye Deponia,更多的混乱，更多的破坏，更多的鲁弗斯。不是一个，不是两个，而是三个 Rufuses 在期待已久的冒险喜剧 Goodbye Deponia 中造成了各种疯狂的混乱！Organon 计划摧毁 Deponia，可爱的 Goal （再次）消失了，反英雄 Rufus 似乎无法停止妨碍他自己的方式。发明家和自由精神的鲁弗斯想做的就是离开 Deponia 的垃圾场星球，搬到极乐世界，这个天堂围绕着 Deponia 旋转，是一艘为社会最高层保留的宇宙飞船。Goal，那个被 Rufus 倾倒的前 Elysian 女孩，似乎仍然是他努力的关键......以及将他送往太空的电梯。最后，Rufus 想出了一个看似完美的计划。然而，所有可能出错的事情都会突然出错。Rufus 发现自己（最初是乔装打扮的）在一辆公路巡洋舰上，周围是面容严肃的 Organon 官员，而 Goal 则失踪了。当 Rufus 偶然发现一台克隆机器时，他认为自己已经找到了出路。克隆副本应该可以帮助他摆脱困境。但是一个“莫名其妙”的错误导致了复杂性，Goal 再次从我们的英雄的触手可及的地方溜走。现在，他必须解决三个主要问题：他需要再次找到目标，到达极乐世界，并防止整个 Deponia 星球被 Organon 之手摧毁。只有三个 Rufuse 才能解决的三个问题 - 因此，这位不走运的发明家决定克隆自己！这给玩家带来了疯狂的后果：在 Goodbye Deponia 中，玩家偶尔需要控制所有三个 Rufuse，使用它们一起完成任务——尽管 Rufus 经常被自己绊倒。Goodbye Deponia 是 Deponia 三部曲的史诗般的结局，也是 2013 年德国最佳游戏（德国电脑游戏奖）的续集。屡获殊荣的 Deponia 系列由来自垃圾场星球 Deponia 的三个古怪的冒险故事组成。这些经典的点击式嬉戏不仅让喜剧迷和冒险老手感到高兴，也让这种类型的新手感到高兴。幽默的 Deponia 系列以精美的手绘 2D 漫画图形、讽刺性的对话和大量的黑色幽默给人留下深刻印象。它获得了众多新闻奖项，其中包括德国计算机游戏奖 （Deutscher Computerspielpreis） 和许多其他德国开发者奖。,"More chaos, more destruction, more Rufus. Not one, not two, but three Rufuses cause all kinds of crazy mayhem in the long-awaited adventure comedy Goodbye Deponia! The Organon plans the destruction of Deponia, the lovely Goal has (once again) disappeared, and anti-hero Rufus just can't seem to stop getting in his own way. All inventor and free spirit Rufus wanted to do was to get off the junkyard planet of Deponia and move to Elysium, the paradise orbiting Deponia as a spaceship reserved for the highest echelons of society. Goal, the ex-Elysian girl that Rufus has fallen head over heels for, still seems to be the key to his endeavor...and to the elevator that will get him to space. Finally, Rufus has come up with a seemingly perfect plan. And yet, everything that could possibly go wrong suddenly does go wrong. Rufus finds himself (initially in disguise) on a highway cruiser amongst stern-faced officials of the Organon, while Goal goes missing. When Rufus stumbles upon a cloning machine, he believes to have found his way out. A clone copy is supposed to help him out of his predicament. But an 'inexplicable' error causes complications and Goal slips from our hero's reach once again. Now, he has to solve three major problems: He needs to find Goal again, reach Elysium and prevent the destruction of the entire planet of Deponia by the hand of the Organon. Three problems that only three Rufuses could solve – and thus, the luckless inventor decides to clone himself! This leads to crazy ramifications for the player: In Goodbye Deponia, the player occasionally needs to control all three Rufuses, using them to complete tasks together – despite Rufus stumbling over himself so often. Goodbye Deponia is the epic conclusion to the Deponia trilogy and sequel to the best German game of 2013 (German Computer Game Awards). The award-winning Deponia series comprises of three wacky tales of adventure from the junkyard planet Deponia.

It's also 'a sequel to [Arcen's] enormo-space RTS AI War, which we called 'one of this year's finest strategy games' back in 2009' (Tom Sykes, PC Gamer) The most devious and acclaimed artificial intelligence in strategy gaming evolves. Most recent is 2021's Paradigm Shift (which has overviews and tutorials in that link). Every year since 2018, this AI has become more devious -- and the factions facing it, subordinate to it, or simply neighbors with it grow more numerous and more lifelike. The premise is simple: you've already lost the war. The entire galaxy belongs to other factions, mostly the AI. You are starting with one small planet in a sea of hostile territory, and you must endeavor not to draw too much notice from the AI. Your job is to carefully evaluate targets, strategically expand your territory just enough to run your fleets and defensive networks, and then strike at the heart of the AI(s) when you are ready. AI War 2 is meant to be both accessible and deep. Early 2021 has seen major improvements to make the midgame easier to get into for new players, plus a more forgiving Science system and a much more powerful Hacking system. Q3 2021 is going to introduce a new Expert mode for those who want the more extreme sort of challenge that comes from having elements of permanent loss, more reasons to hold disadvantageous positions, and so on. Which mode you choose to play will always remain a personal choice. Unexpected Technical Advancements In the twelve years since we coded the first AI War, we've made a lot of improvements to our simulation engine, which is now running on top of the Unity 3D engine. However, AI War 2 has presented some truly unique technical challenges, mainly involving running insane amounts of AI and simulations in a massively parallel fashion. We've been able to harness the power of modern multi-core processors to a degree that most game simulations cannot, and our challenge from 2020 onward has been to bring that into the multiplayer realm. While multiplayer currently remains in beta, it is also a bit of a technical showcase. Mod support is heavily embraced by this game, and having mods be multiplayer-safe (or have deep access to change parts of the core simulation in general) is not typical for games as a whole, let alone this genre. We've managed to make multiplayer a self-repairing affair, which is beneficial both for playing with friends on different OSes and hardware, and for having most mod-code mistakes be corrected by the core game. The AI has dramatically improved in intelligence every year since 2018, and your framerate is also decoupled from your simulation performance. You can have a great machine with 120fps during heavy battles, and a friend at 30fps and you both stay in sync and the actually simulation doesn't slow down. You can speed up and slow down the simulation without any extra load on your CPU, which is very helpful to avoid any boring waiting around, and you can pause at will. The interface respects your time by automating things that you would do the same 95% of the time anyway. For that other 5% there are indeed advanced features such as placing spy nanites, tweaking or disabling the rules of automation, or redesigning your fleet compositions as much as you want. Hacking is one of the most interesting ways to customize your existing fleet leaders, as you can give them unusual upgrades or even transform them into new versions of their class. Streamlined, yet deeper. Sometimes when a sequel says it's 'streamlined,' it can really mean 'dumbed down.' And there are indeed fewer tiny choices to be made in some areas here: you don't have to decide how to wash each dish; you have a dishwasher. And it's a good thing you do, to be honest, because the rabbit hole of complex and confounding scenarios goes as deep as you want it to. If you want to play at a level approaching Expert, you'll need that spare brainpower to design your fleets, manage multiple fronts at once, juggle offense and defense, and continually revise your empire design to suit your needs as the campaign unfolds. If you want to play more casually, that is absolutely okay as well, and the game can be much more forgiving while still providing a lot of interesting macro choices. There's too much to memorize (but tooltips are always right there, anyway), and there's always an unfamiliar element. Clicking fast won't help you. To win the AI War, you'll have to improvise, adapt, and use your wits. As it should be. How About Some Highlights? Many optional factions, each with their own goals and strategies, create a living galaxy. The fleets system gives you tons of ships that can be organized and distributed with a minimum of fuss. Science upgrades are simple to manage, but provide many options on how to approach any given campaign based on your preferences and what you find in the wild. Hack the enemy, hack your allies, hack yourself. Hacking points are limited, but extremely powerful ways to get more ships or capabilities, directly weaken enemies, or even steal from enemies. A ton of map types, and with a lot of sub-options to make them even more varied. Outguard can be hired as a way of deploying surprise mobile forces whever you need, and many factions can be allies. Warden, Hunter, and Praetorian Guard sub-fleets of the AI provide for new challenges (and sometimes opportunities) in how both you and the AI interact with each other. Crazy moddability, with many levers available in easily-accessible XML. A number of player-supported mods are shipped directly with the game (defaulting to off) so that you always have the latest version of them and don't have to hunt for them to download them. What's New Compared To The Original? More approachable gameplay, but with a rabbit hole that goes as deep as ever. More to do, in terms of moment to moment gameplay and choices. More to find, more to conquer or be conquered-by. Polished gameplay mechanics, representing everything learned from first game’s six expansions (plus three years of development on this sequel). Trimmed fat: repetitive boring tasks have been automated or streamlined, but more options than ever have been added for you to customize things when you want to. Our goal is never to waste your time, but always have an array of interesting challenges for you to pursue at once. Redesigned UI that gives you a ton of information and power right when you need it. 1.5 hours of new music added to the 4.5 hour included score from the original game. Multithreading for modern performance, and a codebase that will not summon an elder god (recoded from the ground up for modern rigs). Over 1900 lines of spoken dialogue from more than 25 actors.","“[AI War 2] 提供了其他人无法接近的体验。当你成功时,你会觉得尽管一个不屈不挠的敌人尽了最大努力,但你还是做到了。4/5 – Strategy Gamer “为银河战争设定了新标准。...它提供了大规模的太空战斗,并在您如何进行下一步行动以接管 AI 方面提供了极大的自由度。同时,它非常易于理解和玩转,使其成为我们体验过的最好的太空 RTS 游戏之一。9/10 – GamesHedge“总而言之,强烈推荐 AI War II。真的没有什么能比得上它,Arcen Games 清楚地知道哪些游戏系统必须保留,哪些需要改变。将 micro 从窗户扔出去的意愿是惊人的。这是一次彻头彻尾的好体验。只要控制住那个黑暗尖塔就行了。8/10 – PC 入侵","“[AI War 2] provides an experience that no one else gets near.

Highest level, bestest gear, ruggedly handsome, and unrepentant jerk. For refusing to aid one stinking demon-infested town, you are immediately – and deservedly – cursed. Your powers, your wealth, and your weapons… Poof! Gone. To overcome the curse, you’ll need to make use of whatever weapons you can find. Swords, chainsaws, machine guns, pogo sticks… Use them while you can. Because they’ll all fall apart in your hands. I can’t think of a curse that ever did anyone any good. And this one, doubly so. Fill up your combo meter by defeating evil, vanquish demons to regain your strength, and weaken the curse while you can. But beware. Whenever you aren’t attacking, your combo will quickly drain away, and the curse will continue to sap your strength. Only by killing monsters quickly, adapting to new weapons, and removing the curse in pieces can Doug make his way through the depths of the dungeon and get the hell out of this one-horse town. Roguelike adventure in a fast-paced arena filled with a variety of creatures to kill. Pulse-pounding weapon swaps requiring constant adaptation to defeat the enemy swarms. A frantic paced curse requiring constant engagement to catch and surpass the difficulty curve. Copious demon gore and goop to trade with Hellside vendors for powerful upgrades. Epic soundtrack from Christopher Hoag. Go forth, kill a bunch of things, and don’t even feel bad.","“这是几乎任何人都喜欢时不时地拿起进行短时间游戏的一种友好游戏,尤其是那些喜欢带有幽默感和复古风味的地牢爬行者的人。”7 – 游戏点","“This is one of those friendly games that just about anyone would enjoy picking up for short play sessions every now and again, especially those who like their dungeon crawlers tinged with a sense of humor and a retro flavor.” 7 – GameSpot"

1885 年智利 vs 美国：巴拿马危机
1884 年，智利在太平洋战争中崛起，成为威胁美国霸权的潜在力量。当时智利海军是太平洋地区最强大的舰队，足以抗衡美国政策。1882 年，智利拒绝美国对太平洋战争的调停。1885 年，当美国海军占领当时属于哥伦比亚的科隆时，智利政府下令其海军占领巴拿马城，并迫使美国分舰队撤离科隆。
1885 年德国 vs 西班牙：卡罗琳群岛危机
德国开展殖民事业的时间极晚，因此处于劣势 —— 理想的殖民地点已被悉数占据。西班牙宣称卡罗琳群岛为其殖民地，但实际并未控制此地。德国对西班牙的主权主张提出异议。1885 年 8 月，西班牙派遣军舰前往雅浦岛（卡罗琳群岛）宣示领土主权；然而德国政府已获悉这些舰只动向，其分舰队在西班牙登陆前夜抵达。
1887 年西班牙 vs 美国：马里亚纳事件
为强化在太平洋的地位，美国需要控制至少一个热带岛屿，如西班牙的马里亚纳群岛或萨摩亚群岛。古巴事件与内部问题使西班牙无法加强其在大洋洲的殖民地。列强无意支持西班牙在太平洋的利益，未介入冲突。参战各方均无意爆发大规模战争，因此，唯有热带海域殖民分舰队的快速交锋，将决定 1887 年后马里亚纳群岛的归属。
1889 年德国 vs 美国：萨摩亚危机
萨摩亚群岛是大洋洲最后一片未被殖民的领土。德意志帝国通过部落最高酋长试图掌控萨摩亚，这引发了当地原住民的内战。美国支持反叛势力，两国政府均向萨摩亚最大且最繁忙的阿皮亚港派遣了军舰。海军分舰队指挥官已做好战斗准备，贸易与战略利益的冲突唯有通过武力解决。
游戏特色：四合一游戏包！","A steam-ship period naval combat games focusing on fleet-scale battles in real time. The naval combat game allows you to set up battle squadron groups, their formations and management, with realistic ship models and characteristics, as well as advanced ballistic and weapon models. (Alternative History) In the second half of 1880s, the policy of imperialism in the tropical Pacific led to a local naval conflict between the U.S., Chile, the German Empire and the Kingdom of Spain. None of the contestants wanted a big war. Therefore, only the quick clash of colonial squadrons in tropical waters will decide who will rule Oceania. ************************************************************************************************************************** Panama Crisis with Chile vs USA 1885 In 1884 Chile emerged from the War of the Pacific as a potential threat to the hegemony of the United States. The Chilean navy, then the strongest fleet in the Pacific, was able to confront American policy. In 1882 Chile refused US mediation in the War of the Pacific. In 1885, as the United States Navy occupied Colon, then part of Colombia, the Chilean government ordered its navy to occupy Panama City and to force the American squadron to evacuate Colon. ************************************************************************************************************************** Caroline Islands Crisis with Germany vs Spain 1885 Germany began her colonial enterprise very late and was, therefore, at a disadvantage, finding all the desirable places already occupied. The Spaniards claimed the Caroline Islands as their colony, but did not actually control them. Germany disputed the Spanish claim. In August of 1885, Spain sent warships to Yap (Caroline Islands) to assert their territorial claim; however, the German government was aware of these ships and its squadron arrived the night before the Spanish landed. ************************************************************************************************************************** Marianas Incident with Spain vs USA 1887 To strengthen its position in the Pacific Ocean; the United States needs to control at least one of the tropical islands such as the Spanish Mariana Islands, or the Samoan archipelago. Events in Cuba and internal problems did not allow Spain to strengthen its colony in Oceania. The Great powers were not interested in supporting the interests of Spain in the Pacific and did not interfere in the conflict. None of the contestants wanted a big war. Therefore, only the quick clash of colonial squadrons in tropical waters will decide who will rule the Mariana Islands after 1887. ************************************************************************************************************************** Samoan Crisis with Germany vs USA 1889 The Samoan archipelago is the last of the territories of Oceania which has not yet been colonized. The German Empire, through the tribal supreme chief, is trying to establish control over the Samoa. This leads to civil war between the natives. The United States supports the rebels. Governments of both nations have sent warships to the largest and busiest Apia harbor in Samoa. The commanders of naval squadrons ready for battle. Conflict of trade and strategic interests can be resolved only by force. Features: 4 games in one package!",78% – 扶手椅将军,78% – Armchair General

Build, harvest, and take resources from an environment where your every action affects the world around you. An imminent meteor strike threatens global destruction. Can you save the world without destroying it in the process? Construct buildings and towns, tend to your farm, hunt wildlife, build infrastructure and transportation, craft clothing, build power plants, and research new technologies. Specialize in a craft and trade your goods to other players. Develop your civilization and sculpt your planet. As your civilization grows, you’ll need to analyze data from the simulation; evaluating the impact you have on your world. Use this data as evidence in proposed laws, restricting harmful activities without disrupting the advancement of technology. Balance your individual needs with the needs of community, all while maintaining the state of the ecosystem. The future of your world is in your hands. Every organism in Eco exists as part of a detailed simulation; a disruption in one species can have cascading effects across the planet. Chop down all the trees, and habitats for creatures will be destroyed. Pollute the rivers with mining waste, and your farms will become poisoned and die. The ecosystem supplies the resources you and your community will need to stop the meteor. Manage your pollution, mining waste, hunting, and resource collection to balance your effect on this system. Eco is built on a rich ecological simulation. All the data generated from the interaction of plants, animals, climate, and players can be searched and analyzed using in-game graphs and heat-maps. Use the collected information as scientific evidence support to proposed laws. The ability to successfully debate using scientific evidence is your greatest weapon against the destruction of your world. Establish and maintain your own set of laws and government, which are enforced automatically by the game. Draft a proposal to limit clear-cutting in a protected forest, incentivize green energy solutions over fossil fuels by providing tax subsidies and penalties. Participate in elections for world leadership, allowing you to set tax rates and allocate community money. Use a programmable law system to make dynamic and flexible rules for the community, passing them by vote. Construct a wide variety of governments; from tightly-regulated dictator-states, to tax-and-spend subsidy programs, or even lawless communities relying on trust. Your skills increase based on your food and shelter. By consuming a highly nutritious variety of food and building an elaborate home you will rapidly increase your skill points. Skill points can be spent on skills like farming, hunting, trade, engineering, research, and more. Contribute to the greater good while increasing your own personal success. In the player-run economy, you achieve the most when you specialize and trade both goods and services. Create stores to buy and sell goods you need asynchronously with other players. Setup contracts within the game’s quest-like labor market, soliciting other players to perform specialized work for you in exchange for payment. Build complex crafting machines and charge a fee for players to use them. A thriving economy in Eco can be both a powerful tool for progress, or a dangerous threat to the environment. To grease the wheels of commerce, you can create your own currencies, backed by fiat or by resources. Manage the value of your currency relative to others by setting exchange rates at asynchronous currency exchanges. Sell items at stores and collect credit from other players. Eco is designed for rich asynchronous play, allowing many players of many disciplines to contribute to one another’s goals at separate or simultaneous times. All of the world’s resources originate from its environment, which is affected by your actions. While a meteor looms over head — set to strike the planet in thirty days — a more subtle threat grows from player-interaction with the environment. Without careful attention, ecological destruction can destroy civilization before the meteor even strikes. To ultimately succeed, you and your community will need to use the tools of government and economy to find a balance between progress and protection. Included Features Online Multiplayer - Collaborate online with a community of players. Local Singleplayer - Build your own world, with the option to invite friends. Dedicated Server Included - Host your own Eco worlds. Over 30 different craft tables, with hundreds of recipes. Hundreds of items, skills, craft tables, and building blocks. A simulated ecosystem with dozens of unique species. With limited carrying capacity, players must create vehicles and networks of roads to transport materials. Create your own backed or fiat currencies, using them as a means of exchange in the economy. Build stores where you can sell your excess items for a profit. Eat varied and nutritious food and build ever larger homes to increase your skills. Create contracts for jobs that you would like players with different skill-specialties to accomplish for you. Take on contracts from other players that need the skills you possess. Design laws using programmable template system to protect your world or increase your profits, enforced by the game if ratified by the population. Run for election and make decisions that affect the globe. View and compile rich data from the simulation and use it to argue for group decisions. Claim land as your own property, and share access rights. Give and remove reputation from other players. Find a balance between progress and protection, between individual needs and those of the group, succeeding or failing together. Eco is our forever project. We plan to keep growing, expanding, and improving it with the support of the community. Follow our plans and progress through the Eco Tree, which displays in-depth details on current and future features. The Eco Tree can be found on Eco's official website.","“年度第一游戏......Eco 是一个启示......它让我意识到,游戏实际上对于理解我们与各种自然和人造系统的关系至关重要。让我感到不寒而栗的是,我认为只有在游戏中,我们才能与经济系统进行游戏。我从 Eco 的经历中走出来,感觉自己学到了很多东西,尽管我们没有教练。没有人为我们把这些点连接起来。我们只是通过游戏来学习的。杰夫·格拉布 （Jeff Grubb）,Venture Beat","“Number 1 game of the year...Eco is a revelation...it made me realize that games are actually crucial for understanding our relationship to all kinds of natural and man-made systems. The thing that gives me chills is that I think it is only in games that we can play with economic systems. And I walked away from my experience in Eco feeling like I learned so much even though we had no instructor. No one was connecting the dots for us. We simply learned through play.” Jeff Grubb, Venture Beat"

CUR3D operates completely automatic, fast and absolutely secure. You determine a file to be made printable, set the appropriate dimensions and a desired resolution, CUR3D does the rest, and you can take care of other things. And the best: CUR3D runs perfectly local on your computer system. There is no cloud; None of your data end up in foreign hands, but stay with you! CUR3D is the first real 3D printing prepress, making it the first software on the market to prepare every model for 3D printing. CUR3D supports every 3d printing process and 3d printer. FAQ: What are the CUR3D Maker Edition features?

大药厂,Big Pharma,如果你有能力消除世界上的疾病，改善数百万人的生活，减轻痛苦并治愈病人，那会怎样......并赚取可观的利润？作为您自己的制药集团的负责人，您手中掌握着这种权力。你会用它吗？完全无私可能不是最好的商业计划。令人不安的事实（有没有美中不足的地方？）是有些补救措施比其他补救措施更有利可图，而疾病对生意有好处。欢迎来到大型制药公司的世界！从几台生锈的翻新机器开始，您可以从淘汰针对小病的廉价仿制药发展到发现新的活性成分和高科技机器，以帮助改进下一代改变世界的药物。但要小心，你并不孤单。想要让您倒闭的竞争对手公司有自己的一套竞争性治疗方法。然后是动态变化的市场，这意味着您去年冬天的花哨感冒和流感药物现在正值盛夏，销量可能不太好。我把抗皱防晒霜放在哪里了？Big Pharma 部分是商业模拟游戏，部分是物流拼图。在实验室里完善新配方是一回事，但将“科学的东西”转化为冰冷的现金意味着要用工程和商业头脑来解决这个问题。工厂空间很昂贵，而且那些花哨的新团聚器和离心机并不总是能很好地组合在一起。,"What if you had it in your power to rid the world of disease, to improve the lives of millions, to ease suffering and cure the sick… and earn a tidy profit? As the head of your own Pharmaceutical Conglomerate you have this power resting in your hands. Will you use it for good? Being totally altruistic may not be the best business plan. The uncomfortable truth (is there an ointment for that?) is that some remedies are more profitable than others and illness is good for business. Welcome to the world of Big Pharma! From humble beginnings with a few rusty reconditioned machines, you can progress from knocking out cheap generic treatments for minor ailments, to discovering new active ingredients and hi-tech machines to help refine the next generation of world-changing drugs. But watch out, you’re not alone out there. Rival corporations that want to put you out of business have their own set of competing cures and treatments. Then there’s the dynamically shifting marketplace which means that your fancy cold and flu medicine from last winter might not sell so well now it’s the height of summer. Where did I put my anti-wrinkle sun cream? Big Pharma is part business sim, part logistics puzzle. It’s one thing to work away in the lab perfecting new formulas, but converting the ‘sciency stuff’ into cold hard cash means bringing an engineering and business mind to the problem. Factory space is expensive, and those fancy new agglomerators and centrifuges don’t always slot nicely together.","“就像所有优秀的管理模拟游戏一样,Big Pharma 已经悄悄地把我变成了一个怪物。”Kotaku “太棒了,绝对很棒。”书崭露头角：“这真是太棒了******..这是一款非常好的游戏“ Sips","“Like all good management sims, Big Pharma has quietly turned me into a monster.” Kotaku “It's superb, absolutely superb.” Nerd Cubed “It’s f****** great..

It’s more of a slow burn than other match-3 games, requiring cold, calculated actions on behalf of the player. That threw me off at first, but – flawed though it is – I found myself having a lot of fun with it.” Gamezebo “There seems to be a movement in the indie scene towards these very peaceful, gentle, Zen-like puzzle games.

Origins of Battle Princess Madelyn When Creative Director Christopher Obritsch's daughter Madelyn wanted to be in Ghouls ‘n Ghosts, and fight “Green Head”, he said it was someone else’s game - but he could make her one that was like it. “But girls can’t be knights, Daddy. Only boys…” she said, to which he answered “Pshh…What color do you want your armor to be?”. The answer was pink ?? And that’s how this game started. Chris' daughter Madelyn loves the first stage of Ghouls ‘n Ghosts and makes him play it over and over because she wants to see him fight “Green head”, the Shielder boss at the end of the first stage. It’s not hard for her to twist his rubber arm, as it’s been his favorite game since it came out all those years ago. The Development Team Madelyn Obritsch - Drinker of the chocolate milk and Honorary Assistant Creative Director - The hero of the game, and the designer of the things daddy puts in the game. Christopher Obritsch – Known for sitting there and doing stuff like Insanity's Blade, Escape from 85 and a bunch of other crap you probably never heard of, and also an award nominated game developer. Chris is the creator, director and lead artist on the project. Also the father of the Battle Princess. Daven Bigelow – A published author on game development. He’s an avid player, collector, and maker of games. Daven is the lead developer and slinger of cuss words on the project.

To survive, the must show their wisdom and solve the traps inside the labyrinth, all while avoiding the minotaurs.

Killing the minotaurs or their eggs will grant extra time. Endless: If you think you beat the game, try this mode with the endless levels. Really, this mode never end! One Life You are the untouchable human? Demonstrate that with this mode where you die by one hit. Local Co-op: If you have trouble defeating the beasts, ask a friend for help! Or a family member, or maybe even your dog can help you. Up to four players, so the more the merrier. Local VS This game mode allows the players to fight against themselves. Great for challenging your friends and competing to be the very best, or simply relax by killing your acquaintances. Trials: Players will need to find their ways through a series of hand-made levels. Some of them might even have only four blocks to kill the minotaurs (??'-'?)?. Level Editor: Tired of playing the classic levels? Bored by the challenges? No problem, you will be able to create your own level maps.","“Admito que yo no soy un jugador muy fan de los juegos de puzzles puros.Pero con The Minotaur mi concepción de ellos ha cambiado.”Abandon Pixel “Con The Minotaur nos encontramos con un juego de corte retro en 2D, con una banda sonora genial, en el que lo que más destaca es la simpleza de sus mecánicas.”Game IT “Ojalá tuviesen merchandising, porque sin dudas me compraría un peluche del ”adorable“ minotauro.”Freakelitex","“Admito que yo no soy un jugador muy fan de los juegos de puzzles puros.

The city and perhaps the Earth's surface has turned into a radioactive ash. Survivors are living a savage lifestyle: they kill each other, they rob each other, they eat and rape each other (sometimes both at the same time).

The times have changed and it is time for you to make your own journey into the big world. The biggest problem is that the people on the surface do not know about your existence. They have heard about “underground people”, but they consider those rumors to be fiction. Your objective is to prove to them that you do indeed exist and that you also possess the ability to adapt to the extreme conditions of the wild radioactive desert.

Yet now it is upon them to discover the source of this occult magic in the war-ridden land that they find themselves in, and hopefully eliminate it before hordes of zombies spread all over the world. But how does one retain their sanity when facing enemies that have been spat out of hell? Combat is similar to that of a turn-based tactical RPG, but soldiers move only when action phase starts.

军棋,Regimental Chess,Regimental Chess 的诞生源于创造一个模拟战斗战略和战术的可靠游戏。策略是定位阵型的艺术。战术是他们战斗的艺术。起初，这款游戏的创建者增加了棋子的数量和战场的大小。很快意识到，国际象棋演变成并固化成一个 8 个方格的棋盘，这是有充分理由的。其中的两支小部队被锁定在战斗中，每个位置都很重要。增加田野或军队的规模，以及所有失去的东西。然后顿悟了：以阵型移动多个棋子，而不是一次只移动一个棋子。受规则约束的编队。可以分解的阵型。不需要积分系统。如果一个阵型解体或因消耗而丢失棋子，它作为战斗单位的效率就会降低，直到它被歼灭或变得太小而无法与战斗保持相关性。然后就变成了一个实验棋盘的棋子数量和大小的问题，以创造一种平衡，使每个阵型在任何给定的游戏中都起着重要作用。在拿破仑战争中，训练有素的步兵击败了骑兵的冲锋，因为马匹拒绝冲向步兵撑着的刺刀墙，这些步兵不再转身逃跑。但同样密集的步兵很容易成为炮击的目标。反过来，炮兵本身也很容易受到骑兵的冲锋。这种石头剪刀布的历史动态支撑了 Regimental Chess 的平衡。国王最常被车和皇后的编队俘虏，就像一门重型火炮。然而，如果国王被他的马包围，这群人就很难抓住他。由于它们的阵型和移动方式，这些马极易受到密集步兵的冲锋。反过来，这个步兵可以很快被车和皇后消灭。这完全取决于每个阵型中有多少块，阵型如何形成以及它与敌人的关系。出于这个原因，象的立即打击，尽管是牺牲性的，但最好是为了消灭尽可能多的车、皇后和马，打乱他们的阵型，从而降低对手的进攻和防御能力。多板团棋模拟了将军必须在广阔的战线上进行的战斗，有多个师和司令部，每个师和司令部都执行和发布命令。每个师都保护下一个师的侧翼。部队必须沿着后场转移以防御攻击点，或者集结力量并在机会出现时进行攻击。毕竟，我们对我们创建的游戏非常满意，希望您也能喜欢它。如果你的智力有残酷的倾向，或者你的残暴有智慧的边缘，那么这就是适合你的游戏。,"Regimental Chess was generated from the desire to create a solid game emulating the strategy and tactics of battle. Strategy being the art of positioning ones formations. Tactics being the art of how they fight. At first, the creator of this game increased the number of pieces and the size of the battlefield. The quick realization is that chess evolved into, and solidified, into a board 8 squares by 8 squares for good reason. The two small armies are therein locked into combat where every position counts. Increase the size of the field or the army, and all that is lost. Then came the epiphany: move multiple pieces in formations rather than just one piece at a time. Formations that are governed by rules. Formations that can be broken apart. No point system is necessary. If a formation breaks up or loses pieces through attrition, it simply becomes less effective as a fighting unit until it is either annihilated or becomes too small to remain relevant to the battle. It then became a matter of experimenting with the numbers of pieces and size of the board to create a balance whereby every formation plays an important role in any given game. In the Napoleonic Wars, well formed infantries defeated the cavalry charge because horses refused to charge into a wall of bayonets held by foot soldiers that no longer turned to run. But the same densely packed infantry made an easy target for an artillery strike. The artillery, in turn, was itself vulnerable to a cavalry charge. This historic dynamic of rock-paper-scissors underpins the balance of Regimental Chess. The king is most often captured by a formation of rooks and queens, acting like a heavy artillery. However, this group has a difficult time capturing the king if he is surrounded by his horses. Because of the way they are formed and move, the horses are extremely vulnerable to charge of densely packed infantry. This infantry, in turn, can be quickly wiped out by the rooks and queens. It is all a matter of how many pieces are in each formation, how the formation is shaped and where it stands in relation to its enemies. For this reason, an immediate strike by bishops, albeit sacrificial, is best intended to wipe out as many rooks, queens and horses as possible, break up their formations and thus reduce the opponent’s offensive and defensive capabilities. Multiple Board Regimental Chess emulates the battle a general must wage along a broad front, with multiple divisions and commands, each carrying out and issuing orders. Each division protects the flank of the next division. Forces must shift along the backfield to defend against points of attack, or to mass forces and attack where opportunity presents itself. After all is said and done, we’re extremely pleased with the game we’ve created and we hope you enjoy it as much. If your intellect has a brutal streak, or your brutality has an intelligent edge, this is the game for you.",“这变得非常疯狂” The Escapist “一种全新的国际象棋下法。”双冲击器,“It gets pretty crazy” The Escapist “A completely new way of playing chess.” Dual Shockers

风暴堡垒,Tempest Citadel,《风暴堡垒》：这是一款设定在风暴统治的星球上的基地建造游戏，在这个星球上，科幻与奇幻相互碰撞。你将扮演一位来自泰拉的神秘船长，你的过去和未来都由你来塑造，他踏上了一项探索致命世界的任务，这个世界承诺带来奇妙而可怕的强大力量。但你并非第一个来到这里的人。无情的敌人军队隐藏在云层之中，渴望弱者和愚蠢者的鲜血。从基因拼接的灵能者到赛博朋克黑暗法师，其他派系已经占据了你所寻求的技术奇迹所在的古老遗址。你能建造、成长并冒险到足以对抗你的敌人吗？你会对那些不会对你施以仁慈的人放弃仁慈吗？你有勇气为争夺这个世界和统治它的古老死亡种族的秘密而战吗？你的任务是一个谎言。你在从冷冻睡眠中醒来的那一刻就意识到了这一点，你发现自己身处一个你一无所知的宇宙角落。只有一件事是明确的：那些派你来的人完全知道他们在做什么。在你下方，一个星球在统治其表面的全球性风暴中沉睡。你所追求的——你真正的使命和你回家的唯一途径——隐藏在那些充满愤怒的云层深处。终极力量的代价总是最为昂贵。在《风暴堡垒》中，你将在云端建造一座城市，模块接模块，并带领100名独特的船员投入行动，无论是士兵、拾荒者、工人、研究人员还是医疗专家。你可以选择他们的角色、训练和装备。探索拥有超过200个研究项目的科技树，用特长、增强和灵能能力提升你的船员。收集资源，建造你的基地和小队装备。主要目标是探索地表。你首先通过扫描并选择要派遣探险队的地点开始，利用你能找到的任何情报来挑选最适合地形、天气和敌对势力的小队。准备至关重要；一旦你的小队着陆，战斗就会自动展开。生存意味着征服，因此研究和生产的一个主要焦点是优化你的攻击小队和城市防御。凭借完整的科幻武器、盔甲和增强装置，你可以制造从生物增强型超级士兵到穿着外骨骼的突击队员，甚至是灵能风暴编织者。最终，为工作选择正确的工具是取得胜利的关键；正确的小队设计往往可以克服数量上的绝对优势。在管理一个庞大的船员队伍时，你可以根据角色自动装备，例如“突击跑者”“游击队员”或“狙击手”。当你补给新的武器和盔甲时，你的船员会选择最适合他们角色的装备。成功的任务可以带来研究数据，如蓝图和图纸，以及废料和技术物品。回到城市后，这些对于解锁200多个节点的研究树以及建造170多个模块、物品和武器至关重要。任务也会带来成本，无论是物资还是人力。如果你的士兵在战斗中倒下，你可以用各种技术将他们复活——但他们可能会在这个过程中失去人性。你在星球上的进展受到5个敌方派系的阻碍，每个派系都有自己的部队、技术专长、优势、弱点和故事线。克服他们是不容易的。此外，城市的日常运作被战术和社会困境打断，这些困境带来了巨大的风险——但也带来了丰厚的机会。Aartform Games之前的Steam发行作品包括帝国建设经济模拟游戏《香料之路》和一个有趣的雕刻程序《Curvy 3D》——那些古老的风暴下隐藏着什么失落的秘密？什么样的难以想象的宝藏等待着你去发现？你会牺牲什么来发现它们？成为泰拉号船的船长。勇敢地探索风暴世界的黑暗领域。建造一个能经受住一切的风暴堡垒。,"Tempest Citadel is a base building game set on a storm-ruled planet in which sci-fi and fantasy collide. Assume the role of an enigmatic Captain from Terra, whose past and future are yours to shape, as he embarks on a mission to explore a deadly world that promises wondrous and terrible power. But you are not the first to come. Armies of ruthless enemies hide within the clouds, hungry for the blood of the weak and the foolish. From gene-spliced psychics to cyborg dark-mages, other factions have claimed the ancient sites which hold the technological marvels you seek. Can you build, grow, and risk enough to stand against your enemies? Will you forego mercy against those who would show you none? Do you have what it takes to fight for control of this world and claim the secrets of the ancient dead race that once ruled it? Your mission was a lie. Your first moments waking from cryostasis bear this revelation, and you find yourself in a corner of the cosmos that you know nothing about. Only one thing is clear: those that sent you knew full well what they were doing. Beneath you, a planet sleeps imprisoned by the planet-wide storm ruling its surface. What you're after – your true mission and your only way home – hides deep under those rage-fuelled clouds. And the price of ultimate power is always the most dear. Tempest Citadel sees you building a city in the clouds, module by module, and leading 100 unique crew members into action, be they Soldiers, Scavengers, Workers, Researchers, or Medical Experts. You pick their role, their training, their equipment. Explore a Tech Tree of over 200 research items, enhance your crew with Perks, Augs and Psionic abilities. Gather resources and build up your base and squad equipment. The primary goal is to explore the surface. You start by scanning and picking sites to send expeditions to, using any intel you can find to pick the best squad for the terrain, weather, and opposing forces. Preparation is vital; once your squad lands, the battle plays out automatically. Survival means conquest, so a big focus of research and production is optimising your attack squad and your city defences. With a full array of Sci-Fi weapons, armour, and augmentations, you can make anything from Bio-Enhanced Super Soldiers, to Exosuit-Wearing Assault Troopers, or even Psychic Stormweavers. Ultimately, choosing the right tool for the job is essential to victory; the right squad design can often overcome sheer strength in numbers. With a large crew to manage, you have options to auto-equip based on a role, such as 'Assault Runner', 'Skirmisher', or 'Sniper'. When you resupply with new weapons and armour, your crewmembers choose the best for their role. Successful missions can yield research data, such as blueprints and schematics, as well as scrap and tech items. Back at the city, these are vital to unlocking the 200+ node research trees, and constructing 170+ modules, items, and weapons. Missions will also have a cost, both material and human. If your soldiers fall in battle, you can bring them back with all kinds of technology - but they might lose their humanity in the process. Your progress on the planet is beaten back by 5 enemy factions, each with their own troops, tech specialities, strengths, weaknesses, and storylines. Overcoming them is no easy feat. Further, the day-to-day running of the city is interrupted by tactical and social dilemmas that lead to great risks – but also to lucrative opportunities. Aartform Games' previous Steam releases include the empire building economics sim Spice Road and a fun sculpting program Curvy 3D --- What lost secrets lay hidden beneath the eons-old storms? What unimaginable treasures await your finding? What will you sacrifice to find out? Be the Captain of the Terran ship. Brave the dark reaches of the storm world. Build a Tempest Citadel that will outlast them all.","“Tempest Citadel 是一款迷人的、故事驱动的游戏,它融合了非星际飞船科幻小说的一些最佳元素。凭借出色的写作和角色、深度定制和大量的游戏机制,尽管对战斗不干涉......齐聚一堂,形成今年迄今为止最好的游戏体验之一。9.0 – GameWatcher “Tempest Citadel 是一个完整的体验。它显示了开发团队在他们的项目中投入了多少努力。...节奏是由准备和战斗之间的差异决定的,一旦你取得了一场精心策划的胜利,你就会感到满足。IndieToaster “Tempest Citadel 是玩家友好型设计和挑战之间令人上瘾的平衡。”基拉企鹅","“Tempest Citadel is a charming, story-driven title that channels some of the best elements of non-starship based Sci-Fi.

地窖,Cellar,你还记得小时候你被派去地窖取东西的时候，你总是担心有什么东西潜伏在黑暗中吗？Cellar 将让您回到这些日子，面对童年时期最大的恐惧 - 加入 Lily 的行列，寻找她失踪的泰迪 Blackbear the Pirate！Cellar 是一款以像素艺术创作的短篇休闲游戏。游戏玩法以自上而下的视角呈现（如 Bomberman 或早期的塞尔达分期付款）。游戏的核心是要求您在地下室存放的板条箱和其他物品迷宫中找到自己的路，并获得打开通往下一关的门的钥匙。最终目标是找到丢失的泰迪熊，同时避开潜伏在地窖中的危险陷阱和怪物。你还在这里吗？好的，所以这里有一些关于游戏的铁证： 它是推箱子世界中 Bomberman/Dyna Blaster 的一个很好的变体（你知道，因为所有的板条箱）游戏仅在每个关卡开始时自动保存。处理它。有 8 个级别。没错，他们中有 8 个。这是提高您在 Steam 上的完成/成就率的完美选择。您可以在大约 100 小时内获得不错的 1% 回合，除非您在这款游戏中表现得非常糟糕。我们其实已经说过了，但预期的游戏时间约为 1 小时。足以让您从所有这些众所周知的重复 AAA 游戏中焕然一新，但仍然足够短，让您不会感到沮丧。您实际上可以在 15 分钟内速通游戏，即使您在地窖而不是保险库中。您准备好迎接挑战了吗？说到挑战，还有一个额外的、基于时间的难度设置，在您通关游戏一次后即可玩。有一些 Steam 成就，包括那些可怕的隐藏成就，在有人最终发布这款游戏的指南之前，您将渴望弄清楚这些成就。您可以在舒适的沙发上使用控制器播放它。或者你可以一直站着，那也没关系。如果您仍在阅读本文，那么我们建议您购买这款游戏，因为看起来我们真的引起了您的注意。,"Do you remember when as a little child you were sent to fetch something from the cellar and you were always afraid that something's lurking there in the darkness? Cellar will allow you to go back to these days and face the greatest fears from your childhood - join Lily on her quest to find her missing teddy, Blackbear the Pirate! Cellar is a short, casual game created in pixel art. Gameplay is presented in top-down view (like Bomberman or early Zelda installments). At the core, the game requires you to find your way through a maze of crates and other stuff stocked in a basement and get the key that unlocks the door to next level. The ultimate goal is to find your lost teddy bear while avoiding dangerous traps and monsters that lurk in the cellar. You're still here? OK, so here's some hard facts about the game: It's a fine variation of Bomberman/Dyna Blaster in the world of Sokoban (you know, because of all the crates) The game auto-saves only at the beginning of each level. Deal with it. There are 8 levels. That's right, 8 of them. It's a perfect choice to boost up your completion / achievement rate on Steam. You can get a nice, round 100% in about 1 hour, unless you turn out really bad at this game. We actually said this already, but the expected playtime is about 1 hour. Enough for a refreshing break from all those well-known, repetitive AAA titles, but still short enough to keep you from getting frustrated. You CAN actually speedrun through the game in 15 minutes, even though you're in a cellar and not a vault. Are you up for a challenge? Speaking of challenge, there's also an additional, time-based difficulty setting that becomes playable after you beat the game once. There are Steam Achievements, including those horrible hidden ones that you'll be dying to figure out before someone finally posts a guide for this game. You can play it with a controller from the comfort of your couch. Or you can keep standing, that's fine too. If you're still reading this, then we'd suggest you get the game, cause it seems we seriously got your attention.","“这是一个简单、具有挑战性和有趣的游戏,一分钱花得很值！”PlayNicePlayNow （播放好玩）",“It is a seemingly simple game that has a lot of depth and complexity.” NeoRider7 “Even if it's still in Early Access it has enough content to keep you going for hours...

Navigate the professional and interpersonal politics of the ubiquitous 'Spacebook' to curry favor among friends and colleagues. As intense intergalactic conflict rages around you, it's up to you to accrue those all-important 'likes' on your status updates! Whether you're looking for love, opportunities for promotion, or even a chance to play Zero-G golf with the captain, you can schmooze your way through social circles and claw your way up the career ladder. Perhaps you too can finally achieve the dream of an off-station transfer, or even the Redshirt's opportunity of a lifetime: being sent on an away-mission! 'Redshirt’s take on science fiction clichés is amusing, telling short stories in the form of status updates and messages, but the activity of playing the game is rather intense, even though it’s a turn-based life management sim. As if accidentally snubbing friends and causing heartbreak wasn’t enough, a short while into your misadventure, a disturbing message arrives. A calamity is coming. The station is doomed. People will die.' - Rock Paper Shotgun 'Spying on an ex in a video game even though there’s no tangible benefit to doing so WHATS GOING ON' - Red Door Blue Key Redshirt received an Honorable Mention in the 2014 IGF Awards for Excellence in Narrative ! Social Networking, But Not As We Know It... Redshirt is a comedy sci-fi social networking simulation game. Create &amp; customise your character, a brand new arrival aboard space station Megalodon-9, where you start your career on the lowest possible rung: a Transporter Accident Cleanup Technician. You also realise that everyone on the station is required to use the proprietary social network, 'Spacebook'! You hear rumours something terrible will happen soon aboard the station, and it's up to you to stop being a disposable nobody before it's too late! You can do this by interacting (through Spacebook!) with randomly-generated, AI-driven characters with their own unique personalities, trying to win friends and influence station citizens. Or, you can focus on what skills you need to climb the fairly-extensive career tree. Or, save up your KarmaCreds. Or, flirt your way up the station. The choice is yours, and there are different strategies. You just have a limited time in which to do it, otherwise... terrible things will happen. You are a Redshirt, after all! Features Satirical, tongue-in-cheek social simulation, filled with humour and political intrigue. Detailed character creation: choose from 5 different species, from human to tentacled squid creature! Each game is unique: Megalodon-9 is full of procedurally generated AI-driven characters, each with their own random personalities and profile pictures. Customise station settings: define the kinds of personalities you'll encounter, from friendly chatterboxes to self-obsessed bigots. Update your Spacebook, strategically 'like' statuses, and send private messages to your fellow station citizens. Arrange Spacebook 'events' with your friends, frenemies, and even higher-ranking officers, to influence your relationships and skills. Multiple routes to success through turn-based gameplay, from skills-based diligence, to romance, to charismatic schmoozing. Navigate an extensive, non-linear career tree, by gaining the right skills... or just by making the right friends. Make friends and manage romantic relationships -- if you can handle the drama! Strategically manage your interests and skills. Buy items in the Self-Help Object Purveyor (S.H.O.P.) to increase your stats and skills, from RoboCats to illegal hoverbikes! Away missions! Humorous parody of social networking culture. Puns! So many puns.

Battles are waged on your terms, you are given the tools. How you use them is up to you. Jump into a fighter to engage in dogfights, then switch into a frigate to take out an enemy corvette. Build defensive platforms to augment the security of your base. Issue commands to your attack ships to distract enemy defenders to allow your marine frigates to board an enemy's base. Defend and oversee asteroid mining craft to have the resources necessary to support your fleets. By combining elements of two genres, enemies can be more brutal, fights can be larger and you can overcome greater challenges. Think there's not enough time? Use time dilation (slow down time) to make time for tactics.","“各种流派的融合融合在一起奏效了吗？我会说是的。Paul 在每一个完美之间都取得了平衡,所以你会觉得游戏从太空战斗元素到策略都流畅无误。太空部门 “Void Destroyer 奖励那些设法在挑战中杀出一条血路并发现自己渴望更多的人。”IGN",“Did the blend of various genres melded together worked? I will say yes. Paul has got the balance of each perfect so you feel the game flows well from space combat elements to strategy.” Space Sector “Void Destroyer rewards those who manage to blast their way through its challenges and find themselves hungering for more.” IGN

三天,Three Days,定时游戏 - 在现代生存游戏中，不经常尝试的是一段时间内逃脱的严肃感。Three Days 通过添加 72 小时 - 三天 - 的时间限制，允许玩家参与游戏并激励逃跑，从而为紧迫性提供了新的视角。我们对 ThreeDays 进行了微调，以适应大多数玩家，但并非不可能，对于更休闲的玩家，我们创建了一个没有时间限制的无尽模式，允许不那么激烈的体验。独特的创作系统 - Three Days 有自己独特的制作系统：只需拿一个可移动的资源并将其拖到另一个资源上，看看你能创造什么。没有库存，没有大惊小怪。程序生成的岛屿 - 游戏包括每次玩游戏时随机生成的岛屿，每次玩时都可以进行不同的游戏玩法。不仅如此，每个岛屿都有自己的原始名称和生成，岛上生成的所有资源都将放置在其他地方。Stats-system- Three Days 包含一个动态不断变化的统计系统，玩家需要不断的关注才能生存，这可以通过照顾玩家的饥饿、水分和温度来实现。系统不断变化，玩家总是在一个新的程序生成的岛屿中，这意味着需要不同数量的资源和不同的天气效果来生存。自动采矿- 自动采矿机制受到其他具有不同机制的游戏的影响，这些游戏需要玩家点击或按住按钮来破坏和收集资源。就个人而言，我不喜欢这个系统，想知道如何以不同的方式进行作并想出了自动挖掘功能。玩家只需被带到想要中断的资源，它就会自动开始中断。升级/升级系统 - ThreeDays 还允许您通过打破树木和巨石等主要资源来收集经验，这允许升级和 PP（特权点）可用于角色的 15 种不同升级，例如在没有鱼竿的情况下杀死和捕鱼来减慢计时器。关卡系统也会通过 4 个过场动画直接影响玩家在游戏结束时的命运。就我个人而言，我喜欢一款带有一点背景的游戏，我真的很想把它带到 ThreeDays 中。其独特的故事情节是通过允许玩家玩耍和学习来管理的，例如，在游戏的整个过程中，您会在海岸线周围发现被潮汐冲刷的随机笔记，这些笔记解释了背景故事和真正发生的事情。这是一款粉丝制作的 SCP 游戏，未经网站上任何人的认可或制作。我已经与基金会进行了交谈，并在知识共享署名-相同方式共享 3.0 许可证 -sa/3.0/ 下合法地做了所有事情，这意味着我被允许发布这个游戏，并将感谢 SCP 基金会网站的灵感，因为我独特的粉丝制作的故事。,"Timed gameplay- Not often attempted, with modern survival games, is the sense of seriousness to escape in a period of time. Three Days gives a new perspective on urgency by adding a 72 hour - three days - time limit allowing the player to get involved in gameplay with an incentive to escape. We have fine-tuned ThreeDays to suit most players without it being impossible,and for the more casual players we have created an endless mode which has no time limit allowing a less intense experience. Unique creation system- Three Days has its own unique crafting system: simply take a movable resource and drag it onto another resource to see what you can create. No inventory, no fuss. Procedurally generated islands- The game includes islands that are randomly generated every time you play allowing diverse gameplay every time it’s played. Not only this, but each island has its own original name and generation and all resources that are generated on the island will be placed elsewhere. Stats-system- Three Days contains a dynamic ever changing stats system, where the player is in constant need of attention to survive which is achievable by looking after the players hunger hydration and temperature. The system is ever changing is and the player is always in a new procedurally generated island, meaning different amounts of resources and different weather effects to survive with. Auto-mine- The automine mechanic was influenced by playing other games with different mechanics requiring the player to hit or hold a button to break and collect resources. Personally, I disliked this system and wondered how I could do it differently and came up with the automine feature. The player is simply brought over to the resource desired to break and it will automatically start to break. Upgrade/levelling system- ThreeDays also allows you to collect experience from breaking primary resources such as trees and boulders, this allows level ups and PPs (Perk Points) which can be spent on 15 different upgrades for the character, such as killing and catching fish without a rod to slowing the timer down. The level system will also directly affect the player’s fate at the end of the game via 4 cutscenes. Personally, I enjoy a game with a bit of context and I really wanted to bring this to ThreeDays. Its unique storyline was managed by allowing the player to play and learn, for instance throughout your time in game you will discover random notes around the shoreline, washed in by the tide, which explain the backstory and what really happened.

You are Anna Isobe, a cybernetically enhanced cop in a world that’s left you behind.

REVIEW 'The Sundew is an unrivalled modernisation of the point-and-click genre. It’s stunning, engaging – and best of all, feels like it might just usher in a subgenre renaissance.","“我们有一个赛博朋克警察,一个受《银翼杀手》和约翰尼助记符启发的世界,有大量物品可以在库存中整理,还有甜美、锯齿状的像素艺术可供欣赏。我基本上是在吃掉它。Fanbyte：“Sundew 看起来太棒了。它很暗,很潮湿,有点沮丧,但以一种美丽的方式。你想站在 Anna 的公寓里,把手伸出窗外,接住落下的雨滴。Rock Paper Shotgun “这款基于像素的点击式冒险游戏仍然让我着迷。更引人注目的是,作为一项单独的努力,The Sundew 对于冒险迷、赛博朋克爱好者或任何厌倦了成为活泼的天选之人的人来说都是一种真正的享受。游戏喷泉","“We’ve got a cyberpunk cop, a Bladerunner and Johnny Mnemonic-inspired world, a ton of items to finagle in an inventory, and luscious, jaggy pixel art to enjoy. I’m basically eating it up.” Fanbyte “The Sundew looks fantastic. It's dark, wet, and a bit of a downer but in a beautiful way. You want to stand in Anna's apartment and stick your hand out of the window to catch the falling raindrops.” Rock Paper Shotgun “This pixel-based point-and-click adventure still had me hooked to the end. All the more remarkable for being a solo effort, The Sundew is a real treat for adventure fans, cyberpunk aficionados or anyone who’s sick of being a chirpy chosen one.” GameSpew"
戈尔德,Gord,带领黎明部落的人们深入禁地冒险。完成塑造他们个性、影响他们福祉并决定他们社区命运的任务。确保您的民众在受斯拉夫民间传说启发的严峻幻想世界中生存。竖立栅栏，发展结构，将你的 gord 从一个不起眼的定居点发展成为一个令人生畏的堡垒。然而，扩张并不容易！您的人口不断面临来自敌对部落、可怕的怪物和潜伏在周围树林中的神秘力量的威胁。戈德 （Gord） 中的多功能任务将让您冒险穿越定居点的围墙，以防止灾难发生或解决您的臣民之一的个人事务。该场景的主要目标将引导您的旅程，而支线任务和随机遭遇将派遣您进入荒野，猎杀传奇生物，揭开古人的秘密，或征服令人讨厌的灾祸。期待意想不到的事情。通过从广泛的 Scenario 选项中进行选择来设置舞台，并尝试取得胜利。放轻松或设置不可能的挑战;几乎任何东西都可以调整！从各种主要目标中进行选择，选择关卡大小、突袭强度、您将玩的环境、您将面临的敌人类型、起始资源，甚至天气的严重程度。当然，不要忘记恐怖。健康的民众是戈德生存的关键。定居者生活的方方面面——从疾病到饥饿，再到他们的亲属的死亡——都会影响每个对象的理智水平。密切关注他们，因为一旦受试者的理智达到临界点，他们就会崩溃甚至逃离您的统治。请众神祈祷，他们可能会让您使用他们的施法能力。咒语的性质各不相同 - 有些是冒犯性的，有些是防御性的 - 但它们都有助于使战场对你有利。向敌人隐藏区域，控制威胁性的野兽，或对所有敢于反对你的人发燃邪恶的怒火。The Chronicle 解释了 Gord 宇宙的历史，它将现实世界的斯拉夫神话与黑暗幻想融为一体。从 The Chronicle 中撕下的页面将散布在游戏的景观中，为敬业的玩家提供额外的发现挑战。收集尽可能多的页面将有助于深入了解众神、古老派系和神秘的 Whisperers 的起源。,"Lead the people of the Tribe of the Dawn as they venture deep into forbidden lands. Complete quests that shape their personalities, impact their wellbeing, and decide the fate of their community. Ensure the survival of your populace in a grim fantasy world inspired by Slavic folklore. Erect palisades, develop structures, and grow your gord from a humble settlement to a formidable fortress. However, expansion won’t be easy! Your population is constantly at risk from enemy tribes, gruesome monsters, and mysterious powers that lurk in the surrounding woods. The versatile quests in Gord will have you venturing beyond the walls of your settlement, either to prevent calamity from happening or to address a personal matter of one of your subjects. The Scenario’s main objectives will guide your journey, while side quests and random encounters will dispatch you into the wilderness to hunt down legendary creatures, uncover secrets of the Ancients, or vanquish a nasty scourge. Expect the unexpected. Set the stage by choosing from a wide range of Scenario options, and try to emerge victorious. Take it easy or set an impossible challenge; almost anything can be adjusted! Choose from a variety of primary objectives, select the level size, the intensity of raids, the environment you’ll play in, the types of enemies you’ll face, starting resources, and even the severity of weather. Of course, don’t forget the Horrors. A healthy populace is the key to survival in Gord. Every aspect of your settlers’ lives - from illness, to hunger, to the death of their kin - can impact each subject’s Sanity levels. Keep a close eye on them, as once a subjects sanity reaches a critical point, they will suffer a breakdown or even flee your rule. Please the Gods with your prayers and they may give you access to their spellcasting abilities. Incantations vary in nature - some are offensive while others are defensive - but they all help to tip the battlefield in your favor. Conceal areas from your enemies, gain control over threatening beasts, or turn an unholy rage against all who dare to oppose you. The Chronicle explains the history of the Gord universe that blends real-world Slavic mythology with dark fantasy. Pages torn from The Chronicle will be scattered throughout the game’s landscapes, giving dedicated players an additional challenge of discovery. Collecting as many pages as possible will provide insight into the origins of the Gods, ancient factions, and the mystical Whisperers.","“这是一次非常愉快的体验,如果说是无情的严峻体验,它会让你永远处于紧张状态。”8/10 – 上帝是个极客 “戈德并不适合所有人,但它的暗色调和高难度值得为这里展示的一流世界构建而努力。” 8/10 – TechRaptor “它的机制和系统加起来是一种引人入胜的游戏体验。以适中的入门价格,Gord 通过可定制的场景提供了很多娱乐、引人入胜的故事和大量的重玩价值。8.2/10 – COG已连接","“It's a deep dive into a dark place, and a brilliantly rich experience.” 9/10 – Game Informer “Truly a masterpiece of gaming if there ever was one, and certainly art worthy of being in a museum.” 10/10 – Destructoid “Best Platformer 2017 - The joy of Hollow Knight is the joy of discovery, always hard-earned, never handed to you.” 92/100 – PC Gamer"

SugarMill,SugarMill,将 SugarWinds 添加到您的愿望清单 / SugarMill 是一款沙盒村庄建设游戏。这个游戏发生在欧洲人在加勒比海定居的早期。它重于人员和建筑物的微观管理。以及经济和贸易方面。玩家从几个家庭和装满物资的仓库开始，您将尝试生存并繁荣您的定居点。您可以建立一个港口来进出口货物。但是，有一个称为“港口声誉”的指标，它将决定船舶访问您的港口的频率。此外，海盗就在身边，如果“海盗威胁”指标太高，您将输掉游戏。该游戏为该类型带来了许多新颖独特的功能，以下是主要功能的列表： 主要特点： 生产线生产：要制作简单的钉子，您需要开采矿石，在铸造厂熔化铁，最后在铁匠铺中制作钉子。或者如果你有足够的钱，你可以作弊，你总是可以直接从船上买钉子。产品过期：就像在现实生活中一样，在这个游戏中，每个产品都会过期。有些食品比其他食品过期得早。口渴：人们需要喝水才能生存。游戏的挑战之一是让他们解渴。（在现实生活中，我们只能在没有水的情况下存活 3 天）测量：准备好收集 300 公斤的木材和一些钉子来建造一个棚屋。你能猜出一座砖房需要多少钱吗？马车：由于游戏有真实的尺寸，人们只能携带这么多。这时马车就出现了。他们携带更多，因此，您的经济得到促进。一个处于最佳年龄的人可能会携带大约 15 公斤，独轮车接近 60 公斤，但较小的手推车可以携带 240 公斤。商品用途：板条箱、桶、手推车、手推车、工具、布料、陶器、家具和器皿都是进行城镇传统活动所必需的。随着这些商品的使用，它们会减少，因此，如果没有板条箱，一个人就不会携带任何东西。密切关注该;)幸福感： 人们的幸福感受多种因素的影响。食物种类、宗教满意度、休闲机会、房屋舒适度和教育水平。此外，如果一个人有餐具、陶器和布料，也会影响他们的幸福感。港口声誉：您可以执行传统的贸易活动，例如进出口任何产品。该指标确定船舶到达您港口的频率。海盗威胁：海盗就在附近。该指标确定遭受海盗攻击的风险。如果发生这种情况，游戏就结束了。您可以通过建造军事建筑来减少这种情况。建筑物：超过 50 种不同的建筑物可供建造。产品： 超过 80 种不同的产品。,"Add SugarWinds to your Wishlist / SugarMill is a sandbox village building game. The game happens in the early days when Europeans were settling in the Caribbean. It's heavy on person and buildings micromanagement. As well as an economical and trading aspect. The player starts with a few families and storage full of supplies, you will try to survive and thrive your settlement. You can build a port to import and export goods. However, there is an indicator called 'Port Reputation', this will dictate how often ships will visit your port. Also, pirates are around, if the 'Pirate Threat' indicator goes too high you will lose the game. The game brings many new and unique features to the genre, below is a list of the main ones: Main Features: Line production: To make a simple nail you need to mine ore, in the foundry melt the iron, and finally in the blacksmith make the nail. Or you can cheat if you got enough money, you can always buy the nail directly from a ship. Products expiration: Just like in real life, in this game every product expires. Some food items expire sooner than others. Thirst: People need to drink water to survive. One of the challenges of the game is to keep their thirst quenched. (In real life we can only survive 3 days without water) Measurements: Be ready to gather 300KG of wood, and some nails to build a shack. Can you guess how much is needed for a brick house? Horse Carriages: As the game has real measurements people can carry only so much. That's when horse-drawn carriages come into place. They carry a lot more, as a result, your economy gets boosted. A person in their best years might carry around 15KG, wheelbarrows closer to 60KG, but the smaller cart can carry 240KG. Usage of goods: Crates, barrels, wheelbarrows, carts, tools, cloth, crockery, furniture and utensils are all needed to do the traditional activities of a town. As these goods get used, they diminish, as a result, a person won't carry anything if there are no crates. Keep an eye on that ;) Happiness: People's happiness is influenced by various factors. Food variety, religion satisfaction, access to leisure, house comfort and education level. Also if a person has utensils, crockery and cloth will influence their happiness. Port reputation: You can perform traditional trade activities such as importing and exporting any product. This indicator identifies how often ships come to your port. Pirate threat: Pirates are around. This indicator identifies the risks of suffering a pirate attack. If it happens is game over. You can decrease this by constructing military buildings. Buildings: Over 50 different buildings to construct. Products: Over 80 different products.","“SugarMill 是一款有趣的热带城市建设策略游戏,微观管理（道路结构、建筑、存储）和经济方面（资源、贸易......不同难度,好游戏“ 推荐 – 游戏奶奶 ”其实是一个非常酷的游戏“ Gray 仍然玩 ”只是整个氛围相当不错“ 喀拉拉利斯","“SugarMill is an interesting tropical city builder strategy game, micromanagement (road structure, building, storage), and economic aspect (resource, trade..)

","TOWER 57 IN A NUTSHELL In a dystopian, post-apocalyptic, dieselpunk world, where Megatowers are the only enclaves of civilization, a group of extraordinary individuals is sent to infiltrate the reclusive Tower 57. Their skills, clips' capacity &amp; the ability to cooperate will decide on their fate. Tower 57 is a TOP-DOWN TWIN STICK SHOOTER with 16-bit inspired pixel art, destructible environments and heavy focus on CO-OP . It is also a modern take on what made AMIGA games so great back in the days. MEDIA ABOUT TOWER 57 '(...) gorgeous artwork, action-packed gameplay and a seriously cool vibe.' - Hardcore Gamer ' 'Okay, so now you have to go over there and buy new legs,' the producer told me. Sold. I'm on board with this. Sometimes, it's the little things. (...) Tower 57 could be the next great indie co-op game.' - WorthPlaying 'Tower 57 just wants to be a fun and crazy shooter for players, providing chaos and mayhem and crazy characters like Abe Lincoln with cyborg legs, and what’s a bullet hell shoot-em-up without a cyborg Abraham Lincoln?' - PlayStation LifeStyle '(...) one of my most eagerly awaited games and a Kickstarter and Steam Greenlight success.' - IndieRetroNews FEATURES: FAST-PACED ARCADE GAMEPLAY There is no school like the old school. Shoot everything that moves and don’t get killed in the process . Tower 57 offers complex situations arising from simple systems interacting with each other - and it does it the hard way. Number of lives is scarce, respawns limited and difficulty skyrockets when you least expect it. TOOLS OF DESTRUCTION Choose from a roster of six particular characters with different skillsets, number of upgradable weapons and gadgets . And if you happen to lose an arm or leg during your mission - you can always replace it with a new, better one! Master these combos and you will never get bored on your way to the top of the Tower 57. COOPERATION Mayhem tastes the best when it is shared. Tower 57's main campaign is designed for both, single player &amp; local/online CO-OP . Flank your enemies, bait them into an ambush, leverage co-op specific weapons, or combine your regular weapons for increased firepower and new effects! DIESELPUNK WORLD Find your way through a maze of floors connected by elevators, a central hub filled with shops and terminals, and a multitude of secret walls and uncharted passageways leading to forgotten parts of the tower. Times of randomly generated levels are gone - everything in Tower 57 is carefully designed and pixel-crafted with the highest attention to detail . DESTRUCTIBLE ENVIRONMENTS Smash them, crash them and destroy everything. Reload. Repeat. Because everyone likes when things go BOOM . Everything - from debris and shell casings to bloody footprints - will mark your destructive trail through the Tower. ADVERSARIES Each enemy features its own distinct spawning mechanism, movement &amp; attack patterns, as well as some weaknesses. And you'd better learn those vulnerabilities if you don't want to end up dead very quick .","“来自扭曲世界奇特之处的幽默提供了无尽的魅力,郁郁葱葱的环境令人赏心悦目,战斗节奏快,具有挑战性,而且很有趣。这是一款非常棒的动作游戏,值得复古游戏爱好者（以及其他人）一试,你会回来的......”4/5 – 铁杆玩家","“The humor that comes from the oddities of the twisted world provides endless charm, the lush environments are eye-pleasing and the combat is fast-paced, challenging and just plain fun.

Let me introduce 'NeuroWorld,' a trailblazing business that has effectively integrated artificial intelligence into toys for kids. For many children, these toys were first true friends, but when mishaps started to ruin their once joyful relationships, the beautiful story took a terrible turn. 'NeuroWorld' became a trailblazing company, becoming the first to successfully integrate artificial intelligence into a kid's toy. These creative toys were more than just playthings; they became true friends for a lot of kids. After experiencing great success, the business set up production facilities, which led to the development of the massive industrial complex known as 'Maybedi.' Many industries produce cutting-edge products within the complex, which is also home to NeuroWorld offices, a special daycare for the children of staff, and a large play area. Children actively participate in this situation by contributing comments on the company's continuing advances, going above and beyond simply providing amusement. The Maybedi complex is located in a quiet area a few miles from the closest populated area, strategically placed miles away from busy urban hubs. You're a private investigator, and one day you get an assignment to inspect the abandoned Maybedi Industrial Complex. You accept the offer after giving it some thought. You begin the game by entering the play area, where employees can leave their children to enjoy themselves. But why had the complex been closed? What lurks behind those rooms' doors? Why did a seemingly successful company decide to abandon this location? These are the questions you must answer. MUZY is a well-known character from the 'NeuroWorld' toy line. This amazing invention combines a robotic foundation wrapped in a soft knit cloth with an advanced artificial intelligence system. MUZY, one of the company's most notable projects, was incredibly successful and won over kids' hearts with its endearing appearance and amazing ability to move and interact on its own. A source of great success for the business, MUZY was essential in helping kids make friends, which was especially helpful for those who were shy. Because of its interactive features, which made it possible for meaningful connection in addition to providing entertainment, many people saw it as their best friend. At one point in time, word spread throughout the entire crew regarding the complex's imminent closure, a development that shocked and confused them all. There are still a lot of objects and traces of the once-bustling factory inside its walls. The complex was first gated off and guarded, which gave its abandoned grounds a sense of mystery. But eventually, for no apparent reason, the guards left their positions. Then, neighbors walking by the condominium started telling stories of a mix of eerie noises coming from its empty lot. There were also reports of strange animals seen nearby. In an attempt to solve the mystery surrounding the abandoned facility, it was decided to hire a private investigator in light of these odd circumstances. The detective enters the abandoned Maybedi Industrial Complex brandishing a toy gun. The detective uses the toy gun with small balls loaded to maneuver through the abandoned building and solve puzzles by firing precisely. The detective's path through the complex is distinguished by a calculated combination of puzzle-solving and exploration. The puzzles become more difficult as the detective goes along, necessitating strategic thinking to discover the truth behind the complex's closure. The toy gun is used by the detective in the third person as a dependable ally, a lighthearted but crucial component in the investigation into Maybedi's secrets. The investigator gets closer to comprehending the reasons for the complex's abandonment and the shadows that lurk in its forgotten corners with every picture. 1. Compelling Detective Story: Assume the role of a seasoned detective tasked with solving a series of mysterious and unsettling incidents connected to MUZY, some with fatal consequences. 2. Eerie Atmosphere: Explore a hauntingly atmospheric world filled with suspense, tension, and supernatural occurrences that will keep you on the edge of your seat. 3. Cryptic Puzzles: Challenge your wits with a variety of cryptic puzzles and riddles, each leading you closer to unraveling the true cause behind the terrifying events tied to MUZY. 4. Immersive Gameplay: Engage in an immersive gameplay experience with intuitive controls, realistic environments, and a gripping narrative that unfolds as you progress through the game. 5. Dark Secrets: Uncover the dark and hidden secrets surrounding MUZY, delving deep into its past and discovering the malevolent force that now lurks within this once-innocent children's toy. 6. Stunning Visuals: Enjoy high-quality graphics and visual effects that bring the nightmarish world of MUZY to life, intensifying the horror elements and enhancing the overall gaming experience. 7. Fear-Inducing Soundtrack: Immerse yourself further into the terror with a haunting soundtrack that enhances the atmosphere, keeping you on edge and heightening the suspense.","“在充满玩具的新生存恐怖游戏 'MUZY' 中,游戏时间变成了杀戮时间” All Hallows Geek “MUZY - 关于 AI 变坏的恐怖吉祥物游戏” GameDev？net “Steam 上的 MUZY 游戏：未知倒计时” PhoneInk",“Playtime Becomes Slay-time in New Toy-filled Survival Horror ‘MUZY’” All Hallows Geek “MUZY - Horror Mascot Game About AI Gone Bad” GameDev?net “MUZY Game on Steam: Countdown to the Unknown” PhoneInk

POLYBIUS,POLYBIUS,《POLYBIUS》 是一款快速、迷幻的隧道射击游戏，可以在普通屏幕上或在VR中（效果最佳）游玩。它拥有50个令人陶醉的迷幻射击关卡，搭配令人热血沸腾的配乐。PS4版本在2017年被《EDGE杂志》评为年度VR游戏，而PC版本的游戏甚至被用作NIN音乐视频的基础。所以穿上你的迷幻长裤，如果你有的话，戴上Oculus，系好安全带，准备开始一场令人陶醉的旅程。在50个几何环境中爆炸、加速和飞行。撞击加速门以提高你的速度。你敢挑战多快的速度？速度越快，得分越高，但危险也越大！沿途收集增益药丸以增强你的火力，变得无敌，将自己推向平流层速度，甚至减慢时间。《POLYBIUS》旨在迅速将你带入一种陶醉的流动状态，并在你玩游戏的整个过程中保持这种状态。游戏中没有老板来阻碍你的进度，游戏也不会让你重做关卡——一旦取得的进度就是进度，即使你失去了一条生命也是如此。我们希望你在每次玩《POLYBIUS》时，无论是否打破了你的最高分，都能带着微笑和快乐离开，因为你享受游戏的过程。你可以选择快速体验，也可以选择深入其中，体验Llamasoft经过考验的经典街机游戏模式：纯模式（从头开始，看看你能走多远）、耐力模式（从头开始，有固定数量的生命，耐力游戏期间不会额外奖励生命），或者普通模式。在普通模式游戏中，你可以选择从你之前到达的任何关卡重新开始。我们的“最佳重启”系统会以你在任何游戏中之前在该关卡达到的最佳生命值和得分开始。随着时间的推移，你可以进入并提高任何关卡的个人“最佳重启”统计数据，并逐渐建立一个实现更好和更好高分的平台。《POLYBIUS》的灵感来源于一个关于一种奇怪、抽象、迷幻的街机游戏的旧都市传说，据说这种游戏在20世纪80年代短暂发布过一段时间。根据传说，玩过这款游戏的人在沉迷其中后经历了奇怪且相当不愉快的心理反应。人们谈到了中情局和黑衣人。当然，传说中的游戏从未真正被找到，但——特别是随着VR的出现——我们觉得制作一款受这个旧传说启发的游戏会很有趣。我们的版本旨在只对玩家的思维产生积极的影响！不要只听我们的一面之词，看看PS4玩家在玩到《POLYBIUS》后的评价吧！《POLYBIUS》！我无法相信一款游戏能让我感到如此快乐。感谢@llamasoft_ox带来的不可思议的体验！《POLYBIUS》无疑是PSVR最佳沉浸式展示之一，与《Rez无限》、《Thumper》和《SuperHyperCube》并驾齐驱——令人惊叹的作品。非VR和VR模式之间的差异令人难以置信——即使是标题屏幕也令人惊叹。@llamasoft_ox找到了他的理想画布:) @llamasoft_ox你对我做了什么？@llamasoft_ox感谢你提供如此美妙的VR游戏体验。迄今为止最沉浸式、有趣且令人上瘾的#psvr游戏！我认为这是你写过的最好的游戏，简直太棒了！干得漂亮，伙计:-) 任何最初的WTF？对#POLYBIUS的困惑很快就被陶醉和大大的笑容所取代。@llamasoft_ox和所有参与者的惊人作品《POLYBIUS》从@llamasoft_ox拥有最出色的3D电视模式——即使没有PSVR也很有趣。我第一次将电视切换到3D模式的原因#POLYBIUS在VR中。天哪。无法用言语来形容。从来没有一款电子游戏给我带来过眩晕感。我对@llamasoft_ox表示赞赏在《POLYBIUS》（PSVR）的这个片段中，你听不到我因快乐而大笑；感谢@llamasoft_ox哦天哪。《POLYBIUS》是PSVR上最好的游戏，没有之一。如果你有PSVR，你需要这款游戏。《POLYBIUS》哇！玩到第20关，现在我感到非常放松？？？多年来我第一次不再为小事烦恼。10/10获取@llamasoft_ox的《POLYBIUS》 for PSVR。它看起来很美，扭曲了思维，极其有趣。也很有启发性！向#POLYBIUS和@llamasoft_ox致敬。好游戏。我很好奇80年代的射击游戏在街机游戏中的感觉。就是这个#psvr 我暂停了《POLYBIUS》直到明天，但让大孩子在睡前试一试，当我泡茶时，我听到的只有笑声。所以如果你有PSVR，那么你需要《POLYBIUS》。如果你没有PSVR，那就去买一个，然后买《POLYBIUS》。我的天@llamasoft_ox到目前为止，《POLYBIUS》 by @llamasoft_ox令人难以置信，不想放手……爱它！好吧#POLYBIUS是荒谬的。当你真正加速前进+屏幕脉动，颜色分离——我觉得我尝到了颜色。天哪！刚刚玩了《POLYBIUS》，这是你将经历的最强烈的合法旅行。@llamasoft_ox的传奇作品这就是拥有PSVR的原因1st VR《POLYBIUS》运行。天哪！你进入了一个恍惚区域，当你终于耗尽护盾时，你会想今天是星期几@llamasoft_ox #POLYBIUS是荒谬的乐趣@llamasoft_ox绝对做到了！为@llamasoft_ox的《POLYBIUS》清理了灰尘。技术上的美好。令人难以置信的Bull @llamasoft_ox伙计，你真的做到了。今晚放松地进入游戏，做得更好。你所说的——都实现了。去随波逐流是你需要的《POLYBIUS》的全部指令。我应该上床睡觉，但我在这里。美丽。谢谢@llamasoft_ox真的，我现在脸上带着最大的笑容，这都是@llamasoft_ox的错。#polybius @llamasoft_ox新杰夫游戏... 立即下载并... 4K 60fps =令人惊叹！插入PSVR... 我无话可说！！！30年来我一直期待着这个！哦，天哪，你们做到了：D音乐很棒，一个非常快乐的人现在终于清理了我耳朵里滴落的脑子...更多#POLYBIUS恭喜@llamasoft_ox它终于发布了，大家快去购买，你的生活将永远改变。感谢llamasoft！！我玩过的最好的VR游戏！终于没有晕动症，超级快，简直令人惊叹。我真的不知道该说什么。@llamasoft_ox PS4VR上的《POLYBIUS》令人难以置信。你完全沉浸在其中??????音乐也很好，停不下来。《POLYBIUS》。,"POLYBIUS is a fast, trippy tunnel shooter playable on a normal screen or in VR for the best effect. It features 50 levels of blissful trance shooting action set to a blistering soundtrack. The PS4 version was EDGE Magazine's VR GOTY in 2017, and the PC version of the game was even used as the basis for a NIN music video. So put on your trance trousers, bust out the Oculus if you have one, and strap in for a euphoric ride. Blast, boost and fly through 50 geometrical environments. Hit the boost gates to increase your speed. How fast dare you go? More speed means more points but also more danger! Pick up powerup pills along the way to increase your firepower, become invincible, launch yourself to stratospheric speeds, even slow down time. POLYBIUS is designed to bring you quickly to a euphoric flow state, and to keep you there the whole time you are playing. There are no bosses to spike your progress, and the game will never make you redo sections - progress made is progress kept, always, even if you lose a life. We want you to come out of every game of Polybius, whether or not you've beaten your highscore, smiling and happy because you've enjoyed the act of playing so much. Drop in for a quick blast or settle in for a long trip with Llamasoft's tried and true arcade game modes: Pure (start from the beginning and see how far you can get), Endurance (start from the beginning with a fixed number of lives, no extras are awarded during Endurance games), or Normal. In a Normal Mode game, you can choose to restart from any level you have previously arrived at. Our Restart Best system starts you off with the best-ever lives and score that you've had at that point in any game previously. Over time you can dip in and improve the individual Restart Best stats for any of the levels and gradually build a platform for achieving better and better high scores. The inspiration for POLYBIUS was an old urban legend about a strange, abstract, psychedelic arcade game that was supposedly released for a brief time in the 1980s. According to the legend people who played the game experienced strange and rather unpleasant psychological reactions after becoming addicted to it. There was talk of the CIA and Men in Black. Of course the legendary game has never actually been found but - especially with the advent of VR - we thought it might be fun to make a game inspired by the old legend. Our version is intended only to have positive effects on the minds of its users though! Don't just take our word for it, read for yourself some quotes from PS4 players after getting their hands on POLYBIUS! POLYBIUS! I can't believe a game can make me feel such joy. Thank you @llamasoft_ox for an incredible experience! Polybius is easily one of the best immersive PSVR showcases, alongside Rez Infinite, Thumper and SuperHyperCube - amazing work. The difference between non-VR and VR modes is incredible - even the title screen is astonishing. @llamasoft_ox has found his ideal canvas :) @llamasoft_ox what have you done to my brain? @llamasoft_ox thx for providing such a wonderful VR gaming xperience. Most immersive, fun and addictive #psvr game so far! I think it's the best game you have ever written, it's fucking epic! Nice one mate :-) Any initial WTF? Confusion of #Polybius is soon replaced with euphoria &amp; a great big grin. Amazing work @llamasoft_ox and all involved Polybius from @llamasoft_ox has the most *brilliant* 3D TV mode - great fun even without PSVR. First reason I’ve ever had to switch TV to 3D #Polybius in VR. Blimey. Words can't begin to describe it. Never before has a videogame given me a headrush. My compliments to @llamasoft_ox What you can't hear in this POLYBIUS (PSVR) clip is me laughing w/delight; thx @llamasoft_ox Oh My God. Polybius is the best PSVR game by a mile. If you have a PSVR, you *need* this game. Polybius wow ! Played to level 20 and now I feel chiiiiiiiiiiled ?? first time in ages I am not worrying myself sick. 10/10 Get #Polybius by @llamasoft_ox for PSVR. It's gorgeous, mind warping and extremely fun. Very inspirational as well! Shout out to #Polybius and @llamasoft_ox. Great game. I wondered what an 80s shooter would feel like inside an arcade game. This is it #psvr Halted my POLYBIUS time until tomorrow but let the eldest have a go before bed and as I was making a brew, all I could hear was laughter. So if you have a PSVR then you need to get Polybius. If you don't have a PSVR then get one and get Polybius. My word @llamasoft_ox So far Polybius by @llamasoft_ox is incredible and doesn't want to let me go.. love it! Well #Polybius is ridiculous. When you are really going + the screen is pulsing, colours separating — I think I taste colour. Blimey! Just played Polybius, the most intense legal trip you’ll ever take. Legendary work @llamasoft_ox this is THE reason for having PSVR 1st VR Polybius run. Holy mackerel! You get in a trance zone, when you finally run out of shields, you're like what day is it @llamasoft_ox #Polybius is ridiculous fun @llamasoft_ox has absolutely nailed it!

How do you rule over gods, creatures, and men who refuse to obey you? How do you build a landscape of villages when bandits and mythology are conspiring to tear it down? Skyward Collapse places you into the role of The Creator, and frees you to tackle these problems your own way. Brought to you by the developer of the modern strategy classic AI War: Fleet Command, Arcen's second full strategy title is equally unique (but far easier to learn): a turn-based 4x strategic god-game. Your task is to build and populate the floating continent of Luminith. You create -- but cannot control -- gods, creatures, and artifacts from both Greek and Norse mythology. The power you wield with these is immense: Heimdall's horn causes everyone outdoors to drop dead, for crying out loud. Your task is to keep both factions alive and fighting until The Master calls you home -- but this is harder than it sounds. Bandit Keeps pop up periodically, as do Woes such as floods, serial killers, guild strikes, and vegetarian uprisings. Every game plays out differently, and you'll need even the craziest of your powers in order to survive what lies in store for you. Game Features A turn-based strategic god-game where you control neither faction, but instead strive to maintain the balance of power. Make towns and war as the boardgame-like floating continent continues to construct itself around you. Persuade your minions into doing what you want by controlling the circumstances of their (brief) lives. 16 gods, each with unique passive abilities and three active powers, help you further your goals as you pass into the Age of Monsters. Level up your player profile by winning games. Twelve unlockable buildings in all! Straightforward controls paired with an intuitive and helpful interface make this an easy title to pick up... but the strategy runs deep. Multiple difficulty levels let you play a very relaxed game up to a nail-bitingly difficult one. There's no one best way to win!

The Elder God has vanished! In the wake of her disappearance, a power vacuum has appeared in the heavens and war has erupted! Tabletop Gods is a fast-paced, real-time, arcade action war game, with a hint of tower defense thrown in for good measure. Playing the role of a god, you and your opponent lead your armies against each other across virtual tabletop battlefields with one goal in mind: to destroy more of your opponent’s Strongholds than they destroy of yours. The hectic battles in Tabletop Gods last at most 15 minutes, often less. At the start of a match, you'll choose which of the three factions you wish to command: Human, Undead or Demon. You'll also choose which of the three unique tables you want to battle on, each one being at the center of its own Arena. Each battle is played over three increasingly frantic rounds. At the start of each round, you have a short time to place fiendish traps and mighty weapon towers in secret, as well as the opportunity to switch your troops and spells for the upcoming round. After preparing for war, the next 3-minute round of intense battle commences in which you'll be deploying troops and casting spells in an attempt to destroy your opponent's Strongholds while striving to defend your own. Each tabletop battlefield is the centrepiece of its own 'Arena'. An arena holds up to 8 players who are free to move around and voice chat with each other, whether they are playing a match or spectating. Spectators even have the ability to shrink down onto the table and watch the battle from a troops-eye view! You can create your own arena to play in, or browse the currently open arenas and jump into an existing one. You can even create a private arena for just you and your friends. Tabletop Gods features a head-to-head multiplayer mode, and single-player Skirmish and Trials modes. The short, intense matches and social arenas are perfect for quick one-off games or for longer multiple-battle sessions.

Every bit of effort was poured into delivering an easy to play game that was as addictive to play as Tetris. Every Press Matters! DO NOT BUTTON MASH! One of the biggest challenges we had while making the game is stopping the player from button mashing. When our friends play tested our game they’d instinctively button mash, they couldn’t help themselves. It must have been the many years of playing other brawlers that engraved it in their minds the notion of rapidly pressing buttons to kill your foes. The game’s designed in such a way that if you button mash, you die. Every press matters. Although playing the game should still be simple, you see a bad guy in front of you, you attack him, he dies. If you punch even once when there’s no enemy in front of you, you’re going to miss. If you miss, chances are you’re going to get hit. It’s a simple system but it’s ruthless to button mashers.

Orch Star,Orch Star,《Orch Star》是一款设定在沉浸式太空宇宙中的实时战略游戏，兽人与精灵为统治权展开战斗。你可使用传统桌面设置或 VR 设备控制兽人飞船舰队，征服必要行星以夺取战略系统的控制权。当你带领起义军完成 15 个难度渐增的战役场景时，执行快速狡猾的机动以击溃对手。在在线战斗中挑战其他玩家，向世界展示你已成为伟大的军阀，或探索关卡编辑器，创建精美的场景与世界分享。桌面 / 虚拟现实：《Orch Star》可在桌面或虚拟现实（VR）模式下游玩。传统桌面模式在显示器上使用鼠标和键盘游玩，而 VR 模式使用支持的 VR 头显和手持控制器游玩。两种模式内容无差异，只是游玩的两种不同界面。在开发过程中，《Orch Star》被设计为对两种模式都有趣且具挑战性。购买游戏副本后，只要你有必要设备，可随时在任意模式下游玩。领导起义：当你游玩单人战役的 15 个精心设计的场景时，带领起义军对抗庞大的梅沃里安帝国。扮演伟大的军阀奥卡・沃图斯克，在梅沃里安压迫近 600 年后，他在分散的兽人部落中发起了一场革命。通过证明你作为军阀的优越性，团结剩余的兽人部落，然后冒险进入精灵星海，征服他们的古老系统和外来技术。发现新飞船、技术和法术，进一步增强你的能力。“我的家乡星球在燃烧，我的部落、朋友和家人在燃烧，这是我们世界的终结。梅沃里安帝国以一系列毁灭性打击摧毁了我们最后的据点。梅沃里安深空指挥部的第七和第十二联合舰队首次打击后几乎没有幸存者，第二次打击摧毁了我们舰队的星基。我们在战斗开始前很久就已失败。注定要放弃，或失去我们剩下的家人、孩子和长者，我们的领袖向梅沃里安屈服了，这是一场血腥的失败。因此，我们成为了庞大的梅沃里安星际帝国的一部分，我们失去了自己的道路和自由。”—— 奥卡・沃图斯克 在线战斗：在最多 6 名玩家的多人战斗中挑战你的朋友或其他在线指挥官，无论他们的游戏平台如何。在自定义团队组成的死亡竞赛场景或带有脚本事件和胜利条件的自定义场景中，扮演兽人或精灵。就像在小规模战斗游戏模式中一样，如果需要更多玩家，你可以随时添加 AI 对手。本地小规模战斗：使用小规模战斗游戏模式，与可自定义难度的 AI 对手一起游玩捆绑的或用户创建的单人场景。你也可以在小规模战斗中打开多人场景，用 AI 控制的队伍取代其他玩家队伍。创建你自己的场景：广泛的关卡编辑器是与游戏一起开发的强大工具，已用于创建战役和小规模战斗场景中看到的所有场景。使用它来构建和分享你自己的不同复杂程度的场景。编辑行星、小行星、恒星和天空盒以创建场景，然后确定飞船生产和团队配置，为场景添加游戏玩法。你甚至可以通过添加对话、行星统计数据和描述，以及允许你编写游戏事件（如援军、行星爆炸和胜利）的强大自定义函数，进一步自定义你的场景。Steam 创意工坊集成：游戏中的关卡编辑器和场景选择均与 Steam 的用户创建内容平台创意工坊集成。这使你更容易分享自己的场景，并在小规模战斗或多人游戏模式中找到其他人的场景来游玩。创意工坊还允许你通过特定标签快速找到优秀场景，对场景进行评分和留下反馈，并订阅你喜欢的场景以获得自动更新。,"Orch Star is a real-time strategy game set in an immersive space universe where orchs and elves fight for domination. Control your fleet of orch ships using either a traditional desktop setup or VR gear as you conquer the planets necessary to seize control of strategic systems. Perform quick, cunning maneuvers to crush your opponents as you lead a rebellion through the 15 increasingly difficult scenarios of the campaign. Challenge other players in online battles as you show the world the great warlord you’ve become, or explore the Level Editor and create beautiful scenarios to share with the world. Desktop / Virtual Reality Orch Star can be played in either Desktop or Virtual Reality (VR) mode. The traditional desktop mode is played on a monitor using mouse and keyboard, while the VR mode is played using a supported VR headset and handheld controllers. There is no difference in content between the two modes; they are simply two different interfaces for playing the game. Throughout its development, Orch Star has been designed to be fun and challenging for both modes. Purchasing a copy of the game will allow you to play in either mode at any time, provided you have the necessary equipment. Lead a Rebellion Lead a rebellion against the vast Mevorian Empire as you play through the 15 carefully designed scenarios of the single-player campaign. Take the role of the great warchief Orca Wartusk, who started a revolution among the scattered orch clans after almost 600 years of Mevorian oppression. Rally the remaining orch clans by proving your superiority as warchief, then venture into the elven starseas to conquer their ancient systems and foreign technology. Discover new ships, technologies and spells to further enhance your capabilities. “My homeworld was burning. My clan, friends and family were burning. It was the end of our world. The Mevorian Empire crushed our last strongholds in a devastating series of blows. The combined 7th and 12th fleet of the Mevorian deep space command left almost no survivors after their first strike. The second strike took out our fleets’ starbases. We had lost long before the battle begun. Bound to give up, or lose what was left of our families, children and elders, our leaders gave in to the Mevorians. A bloody defeat. Hence we became part of the vast Mevorian Star Empire. We lost our ways and our freedom.” – Orca Wartusk Battle Online Challenge your friends or other online commanders in Multiplayer battles for up to 6 players, regardless of their gaming platform. Play as orchs or elves in deathmatch scenarios in customizable team compositions or custom scenarios with scripted events and victory conditions. Just like in the Skirmish game mode, you can always add AI opponents if you need more players. Local Skirmishes Use the Skirmish game mode to play one of the bundled or user-created single-player scenarios with or against AI opponents of customizable difficulty. You can also open Multiplayer scenarios in Skirmish and replace other player teams with AI-controlled ones. Create Your Own Scenarios The extensive Level Editor is a powerful tool developed alongside the game, which has been used to create all scenarios seen in the campaign and Skirmish scenarios. Use it to build and share your own scenarios of varying complexity. Edit planets, asteroids, stars and skybox to create the scenery, then determine ship production and team configurations to add gameplay to the scene. You can even customize your scenario further by adding dialogue, planet statistics and descriptions, and powerful custom functions which allow you to script game events such as reinforcements, planet explosions and victory. Steam Workshop Integration Both the Level Editor and scenario selection in the game feature integration with Steam’s platform for user-created content, the Workshop. This makes it easier for you to both share your own scenarios and find others’ scenarios to play in the Skirmish or Multiplayer game modes. The Workshop also allows you to quickly find good scenarios with specific tags, rate and leave feedback on scenarios, and subscribe to your favourites for automatic updates.","“游戏玩法绝对很棒,我个人喜欢 VR 选项（我不得不停下来,因为我的一个控制器没电了）。”8/10 – 泽庞",“Gameplay is solid...Very promising...Looking forward to seeing where it goes.” Jim Sterling

Don’t follow several and odd sophistical doctrines that spread pestiferous seeds – wrote Clement VI himself in the year 1346 to the masters and alumni from Paris University. The Pontifex addressed in his letters to the doctrine of an illustrious Franciscan monk of English origin named William of Occam, who ran away several years earlier from the prison of Avignon, accused of heresy. He had been imprisoned for four years, until he could escape, and shought asylum in the court of Emperor Ludwig of Bavaria, who was at odds with Pope John XXII. When the Emperor died, William wanted to return to the mission with his order and the church, so he traveled to Italy with his young novice to meet Bernardo Gui, who was the head of the Inquisition at that time in that region, and, ultimately, the representative of the Pope. However we cannot know for certain whether William achieved his goal. Only the testimony left by his disciple years after the events happened, in a collection of scrolls; where those amazing and terrible events that happened during the week William and him spent in the abbey the meeting was scheduled were described. The testimony of the story you are about to revive… In this game you play as a Franciscan, Fray William of Occam and his young novice Adso of Melk on a quest to discover the perpetrator of a series of murders in a Benedictine abbey. The entire game is played in an isometric 3D environment, with a series of objects that has to be collected in order to successfully complete the game.","“La Abadía del Crimen Extensum： el remake definitivo” IGN “El remake de la abadía del crimen ya está disponible para su descarga gratuita” El otro lado “成为僧侣,在'犯罪修道院'破案”爆破新闻","“La Abadía del Crimen Extensum: el remake definitivo” IGN “El remake de la abadía del crimen ya está disponible para su descarga gratuita” El otro lado “Become a monk, solve crimes in 'The Abbey of Crime Extensum'” Blasting News"

Apex,Apex,来自艺术家和音乐家 Arjan van Meerten 的出色想象力的令人惊叹的新体验，Apex 在 Van Meerten 的 Surge 的预期后续中提供了超现实主义和黑暗美丽的世界末日愿景，并设置为原创配乐。“我从 16 岁开始就参加乐队演奏。真的很响亮的死亡金属。但我一直对电子音乐也很感兴趣，并开始制作它。我会有一些音乐，它会激发我制作一些视觉化的东西。这一切都非常融合，因为音乐激发了视觉效果，但视觉效果也激发了音乐。这是两者之间持续的互动。我喜欢深入细节。我可以在一小块上工作一年，但我完全按照我想要的方式制作它。VR 是一种非常强烈和身临其境的体验音乐的方式。我能描述 Apex 的最好方式是，当我 15 岁去听一场死亡金属音乐会时，当我在人群中演奏时，我感受到了那种侵略性和能量。这让人不知所措，有点可怕，但它让你有所感觉。这就是我想用 Apex 做的事情。有破坏，但你所看到的也有美。这真的更像是一种氛围，而不是一个传统的故事。使用 VR 真的很难讲述传统意义上的故事。你以传统的方式在脑海中想象它，不同的镜头，控制画面。但在 VR 中，当角色离开时，他们仍然在世界上，因此您必须以与电影截然不同的方式思考它。所以像 Apex 这样的东西更像是一种纯粹的氛围。这就是我现在感兴趣的工作，将人们置于各个世界中，而不是在这些世界中讲述传统故事。我喜欢人们摘下头戴式设备，不得不再次适应地球。,"The stunning new experience from the brilliant imagination of artist and musician Arjan van Meerten, Apex delivers a surrealistic and darkly beautiful apocalyptic vision set to an original score in the anticipated follow up to Van Meerten's Surge. 'I played in bands from when I was 16. Really loud death metal. But I had always been interested in electronic music as well and started to make it. I will have some music and it will inspire me to make something visual. It’s all very integrated because the music inspires the visuals but the visuals also inspire the music. It’s a constant interaction between the two. I like to go into the details. I can work for a year on a small piece but I make it exactly how I want. VR is a really intense and immersive way to experience music. The best way I can describe Apex is like when I was fifteen and went to a death metal concert, and what I felt being in the crowd as the band played, the aggression and the energy. It’s overwhelming and kind of scary but it makes you feel something. And that’s what I wanted to do with Apex. There is destruction but there is also beauty in what you are seeing. It’s really more of an atmosphere than a traditional story. With VR it’s really hard to tell a story in the traditional sense. You visualize it in your mind in the traditional way, different shots, controlling the frame. But in VR when a character walks away they are still in the world, so you have to think about it in a much different way than films. So something like Apex is more of a pure atmosphere. And that’s what I’m interested in doing now, putting people in worlds more than telling traditional stories in those worlds. I like it when people take off the headset and have to adjust to the earth again.","“Apex 让你感觉自己被卷入了一个炽热的新世界。”The Verge “Arjan van Meerten 是音乐家和流行 VR 音乐视频 Surge 的创作者,他使用 Apex 制作了另一种动态视觉体验。”可存储","“Apex makes you feel like you’re being subsumed into some fiery new world.” The Verge “Arjan van Meerten, musician and creator of the popular VR music video Surge, has produced another dynamic visual experience with Apex.” Wareable"

枪景,Gunscape,《枪景》 受到我们过去所喜爱的第一人称射击游戏的启发，我们将所有最令人难忘的元素放入一个工具包中，供你随意组合使用。在核心，《枪景》是一款FPS构建工具包。它是一款游戏，让你在充满动作的沙盒中尽情发挥你的创造力！《枪景》通过提供基于每个人都很熟悉的方块放置界面的易于使用的工具来实现这一点，用于创建单人战役、合作地图和多人竞技场，并且具备与朋友分享你创作的功能。不喜欢建造东西，只想一路射击怪物或与其他玩家决斗？地图也可以被分享、玩和投票，由全世界的人来决定，所以你总是会有新的关卡可供选择！世界构建游戏按照整个FPS游戏类型的主题进行组织，从早期的经典到现代的三A级潜行和战争射击游戏。每个主题套装都包含独特的世界构建方块、玩家模型、敌人（以及Boss！）、音乐曲目、天空盒、特殊关卡元素（如陷阱和传送门）以及——当然——枪支（加上炸弹、球棒、剑、火焰喷射器、电锯、火箭发射器等等。到目前为止计划了38种武器！）。来自不同套装的资产可以自由组合，当你构建你的世界时，每个套装中包含的内容都经过精心选择和规划，以避免冗余并代表游戏所受启发的真正标志性部分。对我们来说很重要的是，任何人都应该能够创建自己的关卡。在Doom和Build引擎游戏的时代，关卡编辑器足够简单，人们不需要很长时间就能学会为玩家创造全新的冒险。真正熟练的人可以创造出令人印象深刻的建筑壮举，但其他人仍然可以凭借精心设计的游戏引擎创造出令人愉快的挑战，因为这些引擎专注于使核心游戏玩法纯粹有趣。在像这样的游戏中，你测试和调整布局以使其尽可能好的次数并不重要，或者结果关卡变得多么抽象。这是《枪景》背后的核心理念。这也是我们选择首先完善预alpha演示中的多人游戏体验的原因，因为我们认为这是开发和调整核心游戏玩法的最佳方式之一。世界分享当然，如果你创造了很棒的体验，而其他人无法玩到，那就没有意义了！《枪景》有一个服务器，用于分享你的创作，游戏内置了一个带有过滤和投票系统的地图浏览器，因此任何人都可以完全访问每个公共玩家创作的关卡，无论使用了哪些主题包来制作它们。现有的演示（稍后会有更多内容）包含了我们组装的游戏关卡，我们将继续添加新的内容，以帮助展示你可以用《枪景》创造一些真正令人惊叹的东西的潜力！游戏特色单人、分屏和在线合作多人关卡创作！以自己的节奏构建地图，或者邀请朋友来帮忙！在编辑时随时进出动作模式，以即时测试你的关卡，或者只是互相射击。单人战役模式：玩或创建一系列或分支树的关卡，有或没有故事。构建一个完整的独立冒险或一系列可怕的挑战。,"Inspired by the first-person shooters of the past that we loved, we're taking all the most memorable elements and putting them in a toolkit to be used and combined however you want. At its heart, Gunscape is an FPS construction kit. It's a game that lets you go wild with your creativity in a pumping action sandbox! Gunscape does this by providing easy-to-use tools based on a block-placement interface everybody's already familiar with to create single-player campaigns, co-op maps and multiplayer arenas and the functionality to share your creations with your friends. Don't like building stuff and just want to blast your way through hordes of monsters or duel with other players? Maps can also be shared, played and voted on by the whole world, so you'll always have new levels at your fingertips! World Building The game is organised into themes taken from the entire genre of FPS games, from the early classics to the modern triple-A stealth and war shooters. Each theme set contains unique world building blocks, player models, enemies (and bosses!), music tracks, skyboxes, special level elements (like traps and teleporters) and--of course--GUNS (plus bombs, bats, swords, flamethrowers, chainsaws, rocket launchers and much, much more. 38 weapons planned so far!). Assets from different sets are meant to be combined freely when building your worlds and the selection of content contained in each one has been carefully selected and planned out to avoid redundancy and to represent the truly iconic parts of the game it was inspired by. It's important to us that anybody should be able to create their own levels. In the days of Doom and Build engine games level editors were simple enough that it didn't take long to learn how to create a whole new adventure for the player. The truly skilled could create impressive feats of architecture, but the rest of us could still create enjoyable challenges thanks to tightly-designed game engines that focused on making the core gameplay pure fun. In a game like that it doesn't matter how many times you test and tweak the layout to make your map the best it can be, or how abstract the level becomes as a result. This is the driving philosophy behind Gunscape. It's also the reason we've chosen to start by polishing the multiplayer experience in the pre-alpha demo, as we feel this is one of the best ways to develop and tweak the core gameplay. World Sharing Of course, there's no point in creating great play experiences if nobody else gets to play them! Gunscape has a server to share your creations and the game has a built in map browser with filtering and voting system, so that anybody can have full access to every public player-created level, regardless of which theme packs were used to make them. The available demo (more on this later) has game levels we have put together and we'll continue to add more as we complete new content to help show how much potential there is for you to create some truly amazing things with Gunscape! Game Features Solo, split-screen and online co-operative multiplayer level creation! Build maps at your own pace or invite friends to help out! Jump in and out of action mode while editing to test your level on the fly or just to blast one another. Single-player campaign mode: play or create a sequence or branching tree of levels with or without a story. Build a whole self-contained adventure or a gauntlet of fearsome challenges. Co-op mode: invite one or more friends to tackle a dedicated co-op map with you or take a single-player map and crank up the difficulty. Multiplayer arenas: build a map with multiple spawn points and powerups and invite your friends or host a public game for some brutal online action using one of many multiplayer modes, including classics such as free-for-all and team deathmatch, capture the flag variants, king of the hill and domination/point capture modes and different tag/infection variants. We plan on including a lot of these, and to continue adding more, including flexible objectives like race to the finish which could be used to build multiplayer rocket jump courses or other types of challenge maps such as a competitive adventure through trap-filled dungeons, or hunter which awards points for killing monsters so you can create your own MP dinosaur safari. Cross-platform multiplayer: optional where it counts, but great to have for cross-platform co-op!","“我今年最期待的游戏之一是独立游戏 Gunscape。”grabit “多人游戏混乱和协作创作是游戏的生动之处。找一个像样的战斗竞技场,与一些朋友组队,您可以在各种竞争模式中享受一些搞笑的在线或分屏乐趣。推方块","“One of my most anticipated games of the year has to be the indie gem, Gunscape.” grabit “Multiplayer mayhem and collaborative creation are where the game comes alive. Find a decent battle arena, party up with some buddies, and you can have some hilarious online or split-screen fun in the various competitive modes.” Push Square"
心灵战术：解放版,Telepath Tactics Liberated,Telepath Tactics Liberated 是一款策略角色扮演游戏，融合了经典的战术玩法和动态的战场。创建一支由乌合之众组成的自由战士军队，并带领他们进行战斗;将 RAW 新兵变成拥有众多战斗技能的老兵，最后带领一支精英部队进入奴隶主领地的中心。解放并不容易。由于动态战场，您总是寡不敌众，但永远不会被智不敌：一切都可以互动。墙壁可能被夷为平地，桥梁被抬高或炸毁，河流结冰，树木被砍伐。敌人呢？它们可以被扔下悬崖、扔进熔岩池、陷阱，甚至彼此扔进去。但要小心：你能做什么，奴隶主也能做什么。Vibra Mining Company 是一个残酷的组织，其财富建立在奴隶的背上。Strider 姐妹在很小的时候就逃离了束缚，投靠了科莫多战士部落 lissit。Iissit 教会了他们所需的一切，以便为被奴役的人带来自由，并为压迫者带来惩罚。最重要的是，他们想营救他们的父亲，他的时间不多了。但在此之前，他们需要组建一支军队，招募不太可能的盟友，与邪恶的矿业公司作战。一款策略角色扮演游戏，结合了久经考验的回合制战术游戏和现代风格！建立和管理一支军队，从代表 24 个基本职业的数十个独特角色中进行选择。在学习 150 多种不同技能的过程中发展您的部队——最终，从近 50 个声望职业中进行选择。永远寡不敌众，用巧妙的战术战胜敌人，迫使他们按照你的条件战斗。按照你认为合适的方式塑造战场。炸毁墙壁和桥梁，设置路障和陷阱，砍伐森林，冻结河流！在地图上开辟新的道路，在敌人最意想不到的地方攻击他们，或者转移压倒性的攻击以求生存。将你的敌人推入彼此、熔岩、水和裂缝中——并以全新而令人兴奋的方式与世界互动！确保保持您的军队供应充足，管理战斗内外的资源，以确保兴奋不会短暂。从六个不同的难度级别中进行选择，或创建自己的自定义难度，其中规则根据您的喜好制定！随机化战役以获得新的挑战——或通过 Steam Remote Play Together 邀请其他玩家测试他们的勇气。使用独立的战役创建器创建和分享新的战役，通过新角色、过场动画、物品、技能等让自己的故事栩栩如生！Telepath Tactics Liberated 是 2015 年经典 Telepath Tactics 的翻版，从头开始重建。您喜欢的 Telepath Tactics 的一切都在这里，在一个新的、更强大的引擎中重新创建。,"Telepath Tactics Liberated is a strategy RPG that brings together classic tactical gameplay and dynamic battlefields. Create an army of rag-tag freedom fighters and lead them in battle; turn raw recruits into veterans with numerous combat skills before finally leading an elite force into the heart of slaver territory. Liberation will not be easy. You will always be outnumbered but never outthought thanks to dynamic battlefields: everything can be interacted with. Walls can be razed, bridges raised or blown up, rivers frozen and trees cut down. And enemies? They can be thrown off cliffs, into lava pools, traps, or even into each other. But be careful: whatever you can do, the slavers can do as well. The Vibra Mining Company is a brutal organization whose wealth is built on the backs of slaves. The Strider sisters escaped bondage at a young age, taking refuge with the lissit, a tribe of komodo warriors. The Iissit taught them everything they need to bring freedom to the enslaved—and punishment to the oppressors. Above all, they want to rescue their father, whose time is running out. But before that can happen, they need to create an army, recruiting unlikely allies as they take the fight to the villainous mining company. A strategy RPG combining battle-tested, turn-based tactical gameplay with modern twists! Build and manage an army, selecting from dozens of unique characters representing 24 base classes. Develop your troops as they learn over 150 distinct skills—and eventually, select from nearly fifty prestige classes. Forever outnumbered, overcome your enemies with clever tactics and force them to fight on your terms. Shape the battlefield as you see fit. Blow up walls and bridges, set up barricades and traps, cut down forests, freeze rivers! Blaze new paths across the map to attack the enemy where they least expect it—or deflect overwhelming attacks to survive. Shove your enemies into each other, into lava, water, and chasms—and interact with the world in new and exciting ways! Make sure to keep your army well-supplied, managing resources inside and outside battles to ensure the excitement isn't short-lived. Choose from six different difficulty levels or create your own custom difficulty where the rules are shaped to your liking! Randomize the campaign for new challenges—or invite another player to test their mettle via Steam Remote Play Together.

Each and every map provides new tactical considerations, and there is a pretty wide variety of goals....This is only enhanced with all the ways that characters are able to interact with these maps. Certain characters are able to transform the battlefield in specific ways (the ice mage can turn water into traversable ice) and there is even a character whose entire toolset is focused on transforming the battlefield in fun and interesting ways.” eXplorminate “The verdict? If you’re a turn-based tactical fan, TTL is a no-brainer. Get it. Pay full price.” CSH Picone"

Delve into the caves below the forest to find rare metal ores, adventure into ancient ruins to discover powerful items, and find the lost cathedral to discover its secrets.

全面歼灭,Total Annihilation,一场冲突从肉体到机器的意识转移开始，升级成了一场毁灭百万世界的战争。核心和臂膀几乎耗尽了银河系的资源，为了争夺统治权而斗争。双方现在都已残破不堪，他们残存的军队继续在被战争蹂躏的星球上战斗，他们的仇恨被四千多年的全面战争所滋养。这是一场你死我活的战斗。对每一方来说，唯一可以接受的结果就是对方的彻底消灭。故事/背景在遥远的未来，银河系由人类和人工智能组成的核心（“意识存储库”的缩写）统治。核心的技术和经济成就使人类能够殖民银河系的大部分，并享受和平与繁荣。然而，一个技术突破打破了平衡，这个突破允许可靠地将人类的意识转移到机器中，从而理论上赋予了无限的生命，这个过程被称为“模式化”。在核心要求每个人出于公共卫生原因进行模式化后，从银河系边缘的殖民地形成了一个叛乱团体（因此他们的名字，臂膀），其成员拒绝离开他们的自然身体加入核心的机器。一场持续4000年的战争随之而来，臂膀大量生产克隆人作为其车辆的飞行员，核心复制嵌入意识的微芯片来驾驶自己的机器。关键信息《全面毁灭》（TA）是一款由Cavedog Entertainment在首席设计师Chris Taylor的指导下创建的实时战略（RTS）视频游戏。它于1997年9月30日发布，是第一款具有3D单位和地形的RTS游戏。发布了两个扩展包：《核心应急》于1998年4月30日发布，两个月后的1998年6月30日发布了《战斗策略》。当TA发布时，最低计算机要求是100MHz的奔腾处理器和16MB的RAM。当然，这些要求是针对1997年的计算机的；现代机器很容易超过这些推荐规格，但仍然建议使用1GHz的处理器和512MB的RAM用于更新的游戏引擎。游戏特色发布时，原始的TA游戏拥有：完全可活动的3D单位和建筑，拥有多种单位类型——例如，飞机、两栖坦克、步兵机器人（kbots）、车辆、气垫船、船只、潜艇、单位生产工厂、强大的固定防御设施和远程武器。独特的跟踪功能允许玩家在战场上跟踪单个单位、整个军队，甚至弹药。真正的3D地形，单位可以在其上攀爬、进入和围绕的地形，位于超大型3D生成的地图上。TA在高分辨率下运行舒适，甚至在现代双显示器设置上也能运行，因此玩家可以看到更多的战场。在草地上、森林中、沙漠里、群岛、开阔水域、熔岩、金属、冰、水晶、酸以及甚至是卫星等众多世界类型上进行战斗。超过150个官方单位和每个阵营的25个官方任务，用于单人战役。《核心应急》扩展包增加了75个新单位（包括臭名昭著的Krogoth）、50张新地图、25个新任务和6种新的世界类型。《战斗策略》增加了4个新单位、6张新地图和100个新任务。最终补丁（版本3.1c，包含在此）增加了6个新单位，包括一个复活kbots！详细且令人兴奋的战役，专注于各自阵营的领导者，指挥官。核心或臂膀的故事都以保卫主角的家乡并开启战争的转折点开始，随后是一系列在众多星球和卫星上的战斗（使用银河门作为超光速交通的方式），在对敌方家乡的最终打击之前：要么是臂膀的田园诗般的Empyrean，要么是核心的人工木星大脑世界Core Prime。任务目标包括保护关键结构或区域、捕获关键敌方单位，或者简单地消灭所有敌方单位。在特定任务或事件后，会逐步解锁更强大的单位和武器。单人遭遇战和完整的多人支持，允许玩家观看和加入战斗，并组建联盟团队以共享资源、信息和单位。高度先进的武器，包括激光、能量机枪（EMGs）、星爆导弹、等离子炮弹、闪电脉冲、麻痹器和核弹头。变量如重力、潮汐和风可以干扰某些武器类型的效率或增强资源生产。情报措施，使用雷达和声纳检测或干扰敌方单位，为单位提供隐形或提供隐形护盾的能力，以及从残骸中复活被摧毁单位的手段。多年来，TA社区创建了数千个第三方单位和数百张地图，以定制玩家的TA体验。还创建了许多实用程序、任务、修改和派别，以重新平衡或完全转换游戏；这些单位中的许多仍然在今天的在线和遭遇战游戏中使用。对游戏的现代修改推动了16年的TA引擎达到新的极限，通过复杂的脚本实现大规模单位运输、即时全图传送、可升级单位和真正的护盾等功能——还有很多更多。不要忘记访问File Universe和Unit Universe，以下载和测试TA社区的众多地图、任务、修改、种族、独立单位、实用程序和其他额外内容！更多信息你可以在TA FAQ中找到关于TA的许多方面的详细信息——包括完美安装、故障排除技巧以及如何使用/创建第三方修改、单位、地图和任务的教程。关于游戏玩法、故事、杰里米·索尔的同名配乐、接受情况以及TA获得的58个奖项的进一步阅读，可以通过访问维基百科上的TA文章找到。你也可以在那找到TA的扩展包《核心应急》和《战斗策略》的条目。,"What began as a conflict over the transfer of consciousness from flesh to machines escalated into a war which has decimated a million worlds. The Core and the Arm have all but exhausted the resources of a galaxy in their struggle for domination. Both sides now crippled beyond repair, the remnants of their armies continue to battle on ravaged planets, their hatred fuelled by over four thousand years of total war. This is a fight to the death. For each side, the only acceptable outcome is the complete elimination of the other. Story / Background In the distant future, the galaxy is ruled by a central body of humans and artificial intelligences called the Core (a contraction of 'Consciousness Repository'). The Core's technological and economic triumphs have allowed humanity to colonize most of the Milky Way and enjoy peace and prosperity. However, the balance is broken by a technological breakthrough that allows the consciousness of a human being to be reliably transferred into a machine, thereby theoretically granting infinite life, in a process called 'patterning.' Following a mandate imposed on humanity by the Core requiring everyone to undergo patterning as a public health measure, a rebel band is formed out of colonies from the edges of the galaxy (hence their name, the Arm), whose members refused to leave their natural bodies to join the Core's machines. A war lasting 4,000 years followed, with the Arm mass-producing clones as pilots for its vehicles and the Core duplicating consciousness-embedded microchips to pilot its own machines. Key information Total Annihilation (TA) is a real-time strategy (RTS) video game created by Cavedog Entertainment under the guidance of lead designer Chris Taylor. It was released on September 30, 1997, and was the first RTS game to feature 3D units and terrain. Two expansion packs were released: The Core Contingency on April 30, 1998, and Battle Tactics exactly 2 months later on June 30, 1998. When TA was released, the minimum computer requirements were a Pentium 100 MHz processor and 16 MB of RAM. Of course, these requirements were for computers in 1997; modern day machines easily exceed those recommended specifications, but it is still recommended to have a 1 GHz processor and 512 MB of RAM for the updated game engine. Game features Upon release, the original TA game boasted: Fully-articulated 3D units and buildings, with a diverse complement of unit types — for example, aircraft, amphibious tanks, infantry bots (kbots), vehicles, hovercraft, ships, submarines, unit production factories, powerful stationary defenses, and long-range weapons. A unique tracking feature allows players to follow single units, entire armies, or even projectiles across the landscape. True 3D terrain that units can climb over, into, and around, on extra-large 3D-generated maps. TA runs comfortably in high resolutions and even on modern dual monitor setups, so players can see more of the battlefield. Numerous world types to do battle on, such as grasslands, forests, deserts, archipelagos, open water, lava, metal, ice, crystal, acid, and even moons. More than 150 official units and 25 official missions per side in a single player campaign. The Core Contingency expansion pack added 75 new units (including the infamous Krogoth), 50 new maps, 25 new missions, and 6 new world types. Battle Tactics added 4 new units, 6 new maps, and 100 new missions. A final patch (version 3.1c, and included here) added 6 new units, including a resurrection kbot! Detailed and exciting campaigns that focus on their respective side's leaders, the Commanders. The stories of either the Core or the Arm start with an effort to defend the protagonist's home world and initiate a turning point in the war, followed by a series of battles on numerous planets and moons (using Galactic Gates as a form of faster-than-light transportation), before a final strike on the enemy's home world: either on the Arm's bucolic Empyrean or the Core's artificial Jupiter Brain world of Core Prime. Mission objectives include protecting a vital structure or area, capturing a pivotal enemy unit, or simply eliminating all enemy units. More powerful units and weapons are gradually unlocked throughout the campaigns after specific missions or events. Single-player skirmish battles and full multiplayer support, allowing players to watch and join battles, and form allied teams to share resources, information, and units. Highly advanced weaponry, including lasers, energy machine guns (EMGs), starburst missiles, plasma shells, lightning pulses, paralyzers, and nuclear warheads. Variables such as gravity, tides, and wind to disrupt the effectiveness of certain weapon types or to enhance resource production. Intelligence measures to detect or jam enemy units using radar and sonar, the ability to cloak or provide stealth shielding for units, and the means to revive destroyed units from their wreckages. Over the years, the TA community has created literally thousands of third-party units and hundreds of maps to customize a player's TA experience. Numerous utilities, missions, mods, and factions have also been created to rebalance or totally convert the game; many of these units are still in competitive online and skirmish play today. Modern modifications to the game push the venerable 16-year-old TA engine to new limits with complex scripting, allowing for mass unit transporting, instant map-wide teleportation, upgradeable units, and true shields — plus much more. Don't forget to visit File Universe and Unit Universe to download and test the TA community's many maps, missions, mods, races, standalone units, utilities, and other extras! More information You can find more detailed information about the many aspects of TA — including the perfect installation, troubleshooting techniques, and tutorials on how to use / create third-party mods, units, maps, and missions — in TA FAQ .

There is also a separate system for discovery of technology, formations and units. Your Research and development path is different every game and this ensures that the route to success is different every time, too. Explore 150+ stratagems and deploy them as you see fit. Stratagems are complete plans and series of actions that allow you to complete vast swathes of micromanagement tasks simply and easily. This system can also help you respond quickly to a crisis or unforeseen situation. Discover and design 30+ different unit types such as light tanks, walkers, missile launchers and much more.

Discover and research over 100 different fields of technology . The game starts at a low level of technology as your nation drags itself out of the ruins of a galactic collapse, but at the end of the tech tree you’ll find knowledge that allows you to build exciting technologies such as ICBMs, laser guns, atomic missile launchers, walkers, shield-generators and more. Manage a realistic supply chain that has real consequences, running out of ammo could mean that your military is unable to attack or defend itself. Running out of food could have even more dire implications. Extend your logistical network capabilities by building roads or rails as well as constructing truck stations, maglev stations and supply base assets. Develop transport helicopters and cargo planes to set up Air Bridges to support Invasions or to drop supplies into isolated positions.","“在策略游戏的战争中,影子帝国已经赢了” 石头纸霰弹枪 “我真的很享受我在游戏中的时光,我相信任何想要体验具有详细战争游戏系统、引人入胜的世界生成和类似 RPG 的深度人际互动的 4x 游戏的人都应该留意影子帝国” Wargamer “它确实代表了如果你玩基于物流的战争游戏会发生什么的非凡看法, 后世界末日的背景,以及 Grand Strategy Games 的个性驱动游戏玩法,然后将它们融合在一起。PCGamesN","“In the war of strategy games, Shadow Empire has already won” Rock Paper Shotgun “I’ve really been enjoying my time with the game, and I’m sure anyone who wants to experience a 4x game with detailed wargaming systems, engaging world generation, and deep interpersonal RPG-like interactions, should keep an eye out for Shadow Empire” Wargamer “It does represent a remarkable look at what happens if you take a logistics-based wargame, a post-apocalyptic setting, and the personality driven gameplay of grand strategy games and then blend them all together.” PCGamesN"

However, if extreme challenges and platforming are what you want, you are a Noctis Mode player. But do you know what the differences are between these game modes? We explain it to you. - Aeterna Mode (A pure Metroidvania experience) In essence, the game has been completely redesigned to offer you as a player a 100% Metroidvania experience where action and exploration are the protagonists. - Noctis Mode (Platforms and extreme challenges) By playing on this mode, you will not only have to explore and recover your powers, but you will also face constant puzzles, platform sections and challenges only recommended for the most demanding players. What if I started in Noctis mode and the difficulty is too much for me? Or... What if I started in Aeterna mode but want a more challenging experience? The player can switch between one mode or the other at any time without losing progress and reloading the game at the last save point, allowing the Aeterna Noctis experience to be shaped at your will. However, there are achievements that can only be unlocked on Noctis Mode.","“一款银河战士恶魔城,具有该类型中前所未有的关卡。”9.4/10 – Generación Xbox“Aeterna Noctis 是一款令人惊叹的银河恶魔城游戏,它将该类型的许多资产整合到一个宏伟的体验中。”88/100 – COG连接 “一款从头到尾都让人惊喜的游戏。Aeterna Noctis 是 2021 年的完美结局,是该类型爱好者的必备作品。好的 – 3Djuegos","“A metroidvania with levels never seen before in the genre.” 9.4/10 – Generación Xbox “Aeterna Noctis is a stunning Metroidvania that incorporates the many assets of the genre into one magnificent experience.” 88/100 – COGConnected “A game that manages to surprise from its beginning to its very end.

死神菲利克斯,Felix The Reaper,《死神菲利克斯》 是一款具有挑战性的单人解谜游戏。你将扮演费利克斯，他的工作是确保人们死亡。为此，费利克斯必须在暗处工作，操纵命运，使死亡总是最终结果。游戏的核心是操纵阴影，以便费利克斯可以在阴影的掩护下安全地设置他的目标。核心游戏玩法具有一种《杀手GO》式的、《纪念碑谷》式的以及《推箱子》式的简洁性。要成为一名成功的死神，你需要掌握三条规则：规则#1：坚持在阴影中每个关卡都设置在一个基于网格的平台上。网格的方块要么被照亮，要么处于阴影中，费利克斯必须在阴影中完成他的工作。规则#2：控制阴影费利克斯有能力旋转太阳，并移动物体，为他创造新的路径以到达目标。规则#3：确保人们死亡每个关卡的最终目标是设置你的目标，让他们遇到他们的创造者。为了让这个核心游戏体验更加丰富，我们将它包裹在关于死亡、舞蹈、艺术史、爱情和喜剧的多层次叙事中。这样你可以在享受关于死亡的复杂而直接的阴影谜题的同时，沉浸在完整的故事世界中。具有挑战性的单人解谜游戏。担任死神的工作，确保人们死亡。确保待在阴影中。光是生命的领域。不好。控制阴影以到达目标。享受一个关于危险爱情和古怪角色的框架性叙事。与费利克斯一起随着来自10多位独立音乐艺术家的原创配乐起舞。解锁计时挑战和高难度关卡以获得额外挑战。《费利克斯·死神》源于对死亡艺术史的广泛、幽默和怪诞的迷恋。在死亡的文化身份中出现了许多主题，包括《死亡之舞》或《死亡与少女》。我们把这两个主题在《费利克斯·死神》中融合在了一起。对于角色本身和他周围的世界，灵感更加多样化：我们从古老的电视剧《阴阳魔界》、中世纪画家如勃鲁盖尔和博斯以及《探险时光》和宫崎骏的卡通角色中汲取灵感。《费利克斯·死神》的另一个重要灵感来源是制作中的惊人艺术合作者。我们与舞者、长长的音乐家名单和历史学者合作。舞蹈几位舞者为游戏的制作做出了贡献，最终Gunilla Lind和Rapha?l Ferdinand Eder-Kastling即兴创作了最终出现在游戏中的动作。这里是Gunilla为费利克斯做的一个舞蹈动作：还有Raphael做的另一个：音乐当然，有舞蹈主角的游戏需要伟大的音乐——他为什么要跳舞呢？我们以一种让音乐家们做自己的方式设计了游戏。我们希望他们通过个人的艺术表达为游戏增添内容，而不是要求他们成为我们想要他们成为的人。这使得音乐风格多样且奇特。但由于游戏玩法是一种不紧张的解谜游戏，你实际上有时间去欣赏和享受这种古怪，同时进行游戏。艺术史游戏的想法本身源于艺术史。我们实际上是从《死亡之舞》和《死亡与少女》开始的，然后问自己：我们如何制作一款关于这个主题的游戏？经过几次不同的原型制作后，我们最终得到了现在的游戏。在制作过程中，一位历史学者深入研究了跨越10个世纪的死亡艺术史，为他正在撰写的书稿进行研究，每次他发现有趣的内容时都会告诉我们，如果合适的话，我们会尝试将其融入游戏中。游戏中有五篇由这位历史学家S?ren Hein Rasmussen撰写的文章——你可以随着游戏的进展解锁它们。,"Felix The Reaper is a challenging single-player puzzle game . You take on the role as Felix, whose job is to make sure that people die . To do this, Felix must work in the shadows and rearrange faith so that death is always the end result. At its core, the game is about manipulating shadows so that Felix can set up his targets safely covered by the shadows. The core gameplay has a Hitman Go'ish, Monument Valley'ing and Sokoban-like simplicity running through it. There are three rules you have to master to become a successful Reaper: Rule #1: Stick to the shadows Each level is set on a grid-based platform. The squares of the grid are either lit up or in shadow, and Felix has to do his job in the shadows. Rule #2: Control the shadows Felix has the ability to rotate the sun, and move objects, to create new pathways for him to reach his target. Rule #3: Make sure people die The end goal of each level is to set up your targets and have them meet their maker. To add something extra to this core game experience, we wrapped it in deep layers of storytelling, death, dance, art history, love and comedy. That way you get to enjoy a wholesome story world, while boiling your brains on complicatedly straight forward shadow puzzles about Death. Challenging single-player puzzle game . Take on the job as The Reaper and make sure people die . Make sure to stay in the shadows . Light is the domain of life. Not good. Control the shadows to reach your target. Enjoy a framing narrative of dangerous love and peculiar characters. Dance along with Felix to an original soundtrack from 10+ indie music artists. Unlock time trials and hardcore levels for an extra challenge. Felix The Reaper sprang from a fascination with the sprawling, humorous and grotesque art history of Death. Many themes have emerged in the cultural identity of Death, including The Dance of Death or Danse Macabre and Death And The Maiden . We sort of mashed those two themes together in Felix The Reaper. For the character himself and the world around him, the inspiration was more diverse: We took cues from the ancient TV show The Twilight Zon e, medieval painters like Bruegel and Bosch and the cartoon characters of Adventure Time and Hayao Miyazaki . Another important inspiration for Felix The Reaper was the amazing artistic collaborators in the production. We worked with dancers, a long list of music artists and history scholars. The Dance Several dancers contributed to the game's production, and eventually Gunilla Lind and Rapha?l Ferdinand Eder-Kastling improvised the final moves that ended up in the game. Here's Gunilla doing a dance move for Felix: And here's Raphael doing another: The Music Of course a game with a dancing protagonist needs great music—why else would he be dancing? We designed the game in a way that lets the music artists be themselves. We wanted them to add to the game through their personal artistic expression, rather than ask them to be what we want them to be. This made for a varied and strange combination of music. But since the gameplay is a non-stressful puzzler, you actually have time to appreciate and enjoy the weirdness while playing. The Art History The idea for the game itself stems from art history. We actually started with The Danse Macabre and Death and The Maiden as a basis, and then asked ourselves: How can we make a game about this? Eventually and through several different prototypes, we ended up here. Alongside the production, a history scholar was diving into the art history of Death across more than 10 centuries for a book manuscript he is working on, and every time he hit upon something interesting he told us, and we tried to put it into the game if it fit.

Cogmind,Cogmind,《Cogmind》让你在一个将传统类 rogue 游戏与前所未有的沉浸式现代界面相结合的程序生成世界中，体验科幻战术战斗与探索。用从其他机器人身上找到或回收的组件构建自己，安装动力源、推进装置、实用工具和武器，成为装备密集的慢速坦克，或在敌人反应前快速飞行的飞行器，或隐身的持剑刺客 / 黑客，或用找到的回收部件能想到的任何形态。当你失去组件并从敌人残骸中重建自己时，局势可能迅速变化。你是机械心智，在探索这个由机器人统治的鲜活世界时，发现这意味着什么。主要特色：用找到的部件或击败的敌人部件构建和修改独特机器人；无需经验值 / 刷级的动态角色发展；数十种机器人类型，每种在生态系统中都有独特行为；程序生成世界与手工制作内容相结合；九个不同的动画结局等待发现；ASCII 进化：有史以来最先进的终端界面；数千种粒子效果和音效；完全可破坏的环境。进展：尽管目前处于抢先体验阶段，《Cogmind》已是完整游戏，有超过二十多种地图类型、一千多种物品、数千种声音和粒子效果、多条剧情线、数百个手工制作的地点和遭遇、数千行对话，以及九个不同的动画结局等待发现。也就是说，我们有许多计划继续通过功能和内容扩展这个世界，所以现在我们就称它为 EA 吧：D（《Cogmind》已全职开发超过十年）。类 rogue 游戏？《Cogmind》是一款回合制类 rogue 游戏，在许多方面非常传统（考虑到永久死亡的程序地牢爬行……），但同时在设计和可访问性功能方面对该类型进行了创新。游戏内你拥有完全的鼠标控制 —— 和完全的键盘控制！可以只使用其中一种，或两者兼用，所有常见的类 rogue 移动方法（鼠标、数字小键盘、vi、箭头键）开箱即用，无需配置。鼠标用户获得拖放式库存管理，键盘通过多种命令方案和内置自动化功能甚至更快。潜行玩法与直接战斗一样可行，使用黑客技术和信息战智取复合体。缺乏经验值系统意味着你只需使用任何可能的方法到达新区域并找到新装备来推进。世界充满各种机器人，其中大多数实际上对你没有敌意，有自己的职责要执行。地图对象在进入视野时会被标记，减少游玩的繁琐性，让你专注于战术和生存。大量其他选项和有用功能可用于自定义 UI。虽然最熟练的玩家可以可靠地赢得默认模式，但为经验较少或时间较少的玩家提供了更简单的难度设置：)（高级玩家也可以尝试挑战扩展的终局！）在多次游玩中积累知识，在 ASCII 艺术画廊中收集关于以前使用物品的信息（超过 900 件艺术作品！），并在发现世界居民和猜测他们的潜在动机及真实能力时，收集关于世界的知识。虽然在多次运行中可以揭开丰富的故事，但要知道，如果你更喜欢通过类 rogue 游戏进行策略和最大化，故事不会妨碍你。接受内置挑战模式以获得不同的体验，或证明你真的有多优秀。警告：并非每款游戏都适合所有人，因此有几点需要指出，可能会影响你对《Cogmind》的兴趣。不手把手教学：尽管非常易于访问，且有上下文帮助和快速教程教授所有基础知识，《Cogmind》邀请你探索一个完全陌生的世界。细心的玩家会自然内化那个世界的许多规则，当你到达新区域时，也会发现对一切的主题解释，与传说无缝集成。作为该过程的一部分，你经常会面临死亡后的挑战，即弄清楚哪里出错了以及为什么，直到你最终达到能够在危险显现之前就看到它的程度。物品大量破坏：《Cogmind》中的每件物品都可以被摧毁，你的许多物品将会被摧毁。起初这可能令人沮丧，但一旦你掌握了基础知识，通常甚至在失去旧部件之前，就会用更好的战利品替换它们。构建，更重要的是重建，是体验的重要组成部分，使游戏在整个过程中保持动态和有趣。适应性是关键，惊人的卷土重来司空见惯。无职业、技能等：与许多其他类 rogue 游戏和 CRPG 不同，在那些游戏中你可能会对角色职业及其随着时间获得的等级、属性、技能和装备形成某种依恋，《Cogmind》几乎完全由物品定义。正如提到的，这些物品将被摧毁，因此几乎没有机会形成那种依恋。然而，这也为单次游玩留下了极大的灵活性，你可能需要根据访问的地点依赖这种灵活性来最大化生存机会。不同类型的游戏：总体而言，《Cogmind》与市面上的几乎所有游戏都大不相同，这一事实让一些人却步，但另一些人正因如此而喜欢它。可能需要一点时间才能适应，但一旦掌握了基础知识以及如何可靠地克服早期区域，世界及其机会就会真正打开。,"Experience sci-fi tactical combat and exploration in a procedural world that combines traditional roguelikes with an immersive modern interface like no other. Build yourself from components found or salvaged from other robots. Attach power sources, propulsion units, utilities, and weapons to become a slow tank bristling with weapons, or a fast-moving flier zipping past enemies before they even have time to react, or a stealthy sword-wielding assassin/hacker, or whatever else you can come up with from the salvage you find. The situation can quickly change as you lose components and rebuild yourself from enemy remains. You are the Cogmind. Discover what that means as you explore a living, breathing world ruled by robots. KEY FEATURES Build and modify a unique robot from parts found, or enemies defeated Dynamic character development without XP/grinding Dozens of robot classes, each with unique behavior within the ecosystem Procedurally generated world combined with hand-crafted content Nine different animated endings to uncover ASCII evolved: Most advanced terminal interface ever Thousands of particle effects and SFX Fully destructible environment PROGRESS Although currently in Early Access, Cogmind is a complete game. There are over two-dozen map types, over a thousand items, thousands of sound and particle effects, multiple plot lines, hundreds of hand-made locations and encounters, thousands of lines of dialogue, and nine different animated endings to discover. That said, there are many plans to continue expanding the world with features and content, so for now we'll just call it EA :D (Cogmind has been in full-time development for over ten years.) ?????? ROGUELIKE? Cogmind is a turn-based roguelike, very traditional in many ways (permadeath procedural dungeon crawler built with ASCII in mind...), but at the same time innovates on the genre in terms of both design and accessibility features. Within you have full mouse control--and full keyboard control! Use only one or the other, or both, and all common roguelike movement methods (mouse, numpad, vi, arrows) are enabled out of the box, no configuration required. Mouse users get drag-and-drop inventory management, and the keyboard is even faster with its multiple command schemes and built-in automation features. Stealth play is just as viable as straightforward combat, using hacking and information warfare to outsmart the Complex. The lack of an XP system means you only have to use whatever means you can to reach new areas and find new gear to advance. The world is alive with many types of robots, most of which are actually not hostile to you and have their own duties to carry out. Map objects are labeled as they come into view, making for less tedious play and allowing you to instead focus on tactics and survival. A large number of other options and useful features are available to customize the UI. While the most skilled players can reliably win the default mode, easier difficulty settings are available for those with less experience, or less time on their hands :) (advanced players can also attempt to take on the extended end-game!) Accumulate knowledge across multiple plays, collecting info about previously used items in the ASCII art gallery (over 900 pieces of art!), and collecting lore about the world as you discover its inhabitants and guess at their potential motives, and true capabilities. While there's a rich story to uncover over many runs, know that it doesn't get in the way if you prefer to just strategize and min-max through your roguelikes. Take on built-in Challenge Modes for a different kind of experience, or to prove just how good you really are. WARNINGS Not every game is for everyone, so there are a few things to point out that may affect your interest in Cogmind. No Hand-holding: Although very accessible and there's both context help and a quick tutorial to teach all the fundamentals, Cogmind invites you to explore a completely unfamiliar world. Observant players will come to internalize many of that world's rules naturally, and as you reach new areas you'll also discover in-theme explanations for everything , seamlessly integrated with the lore. As part of that process you'll often be faced with the post-death challenge of figuring out where things went wrong and why, until you eventually reach a point where you can see danger before it even materializes. Rampant Item Destruction: Every item in Cogmind can be destroyed, and many of your items will be destroyed. At first this may be discouraging, but once you figure out the basics you'll generally be replacing old and broken parts with much better loot even before you lose it anyway. Building and, more importantly, rebuilding , is a vital part of the experience and what keeps the game dynamic and interesting throughout. Adaptability is key, and amazing comebacks are commonplace. No Classes, Skills, Etc.: Unlike many other roguelikes and CRPGs in which you may form a sort of attachment to your character class and the levels, stats, skills, and equipment they've acquired over time, Cogmind is defined almost purely by items . And as mentioned those items will be destroyed, so there's not much chance to form that kind of attachment. However, this also leaves room for great flexibility during a single playthrough, flexibility you might want or need to rely on to maximize your chances for survival depending on what locations you visit. A Different Kind of Game: As a whole Cogmind is quite different from pretty much everything out there, a fact that turns some people off, but others rather enjoy it for that same reason. It can also take a little while to get into, but once past learning the basics and how to reliably overcome early-game areas, the world and its opportunities really open up.","“Cogmind 是新旧学校游戏设计的令人印象深刻的融合。”石头、纸、霰弹枪 “Cogmind 是一个很棒的东西,精心而智能地构建,并具有华丽的 ASCII 美学。”-robot-roguelike/ “Cogmind 将大多数回合制冒险家的传统奇幻设定换成了科幻小说,并在其中发现了很多有趣的功能。”","“Cogmind is an impressive merging of old and new school game design.” Rock, Paper, Shotgun “Cogmind is a wonderful thing, carefully and intelligently constructed, and with a gorgeous ASCII aesthetic.” -robot-roguelike/ “Cogmind swaps the traditional fantasy setting of most turn-based adventurers in favour of science-fiction, and finds plenty of interesting features in the mix.” -watch-cogmind-fritz-tiny-wizard/"

All of those details look even better in Deluxe, preserved in the new vibrant HD visuals — the same goes for the catchy chiptunes soundtrack (with all new music for the ghost levels), and deliciously retro sound effects.” 90% – Gamer Limit “I had great praise for this game before and so there is no doubt that I was going to hand it great praise once again. It is just as fun the second time around as it was the first time on the 3DS, with the original levels. The new levels and enhancements made it even more gratifying, and players don’t even have to wait long to experience the new ghost levels. As players beat an original level, the corresponding ghost level unlocks, giving them quick access to experience the spooky mudds.” 90% – Fanbolt “Mutant Mudds Deluxe is the ultimate version of an already great game. Some tweaks to how it plays in addition to a fair amount of new content place it far above the original game. If you own the original but some things about it bothered you, give Deluxe a go. If you’ve never played the game, buy Deluxe as soon as possible. Mutant Mudds Deluxe is an outstanding throwback to another age, and it can’t be missed.” 90% – Blazekick"

A popular gaming style in the late 1980’s, Mokoko X looks to resurrect the soul of the arcade genre while adding a modern touch. There are 32 levels in Mokoko X; each level has its own unique boss and minions. The main goal is assisting the girls that need help from the weird bosses. This is sometimes passing a mobile game level, sometimes helping out with the insects in the kitchen. Gameplay The main goal is conquering the bigger portion of the screen. While you are in your own area, you are safe from the enemies until your shield depletes. You conquer new areas by drawing out of your area. Drawing, however, deactivates your shield and exposes you to danger. Your shield decreases constantly. If you do not conquer at a certain frequency, your shield will burn out and you will not be safe on your own areas as well. There are 3 difficulties in the game. The difficulty affects enemies, your shield, and the required conquered area percentage for the victory.

As a Commander, execute skillful maneuvers on the game board and catapult yourself directly into the battle with devastating attacks, chessman vs. chessman.

The game board itself is set in one of six available environments, each with its own unique landscape and presentation features. Traditionally recognized game pieces have been given a facelift as hulking stone golems and beastly chimaeras take the place of the typical rook and knight pieces respectively. FEATURES: Multiple richly crafted army sets combined with 6 different gameboard environments introduce an unheard of visual complexity Two gripping strategy campaigns with 30 missions and 30 different mission goals Interactive 3rd person action mode Beat'em up fights in six unique arenas with each of the twelve characters Challenging PvP duels together on one PC over LAN and Internet Utilizing the famous Fritz!","“Check vs. Mate 必须是我在任何游戏机上见过的最好的国际象棋游戏,它既具有令人惊叹的视觉吸引力,又具有挑战性。它适合任何级别的球员技能。93 – XboxLiveAddicts“可能是我们系统有史以来最好的国际象棋游戏。Check vs. Mate 充满了为经典游戏带来“转折”的一流模式,以及基于 Fritz 引擎的 AI ,这将为新手和有经验的游戏玩家提供很好的挑战。90 – -Vs-Chess.16070.html “简直是凯旋！这是一次充满想象力、充满挑战的充满活力的国际象棋之旅！96 – 媒体评论","“Check vs. Mate has to be the best Chess game I have seen on any console, it is both stunning visually and challenging.

回音洞窟,Echo Grotto,Echo Grotto 是一种虚拟现实体验，可让您使用一系列探洞设备和工具探索独特而复杂的洞穴系统！穿越水下隧道、巨大的开放式洞穴、水晶洞、巨大的峡谷、硫磺池、深坑、萤火虫点燃的洞穴等等！Echo Grotto 使用微妙的随机生成使每个洞穴系统都感觉独一无二，同时仍然提供令人惊叹的位置和深度互连的洞穴，因为每个洞穴和通道都是手工制作和独特设计的。每次你踏上 Echo Grotto 的洞穴时，你永远不会知道拐角处会发生什么！在你进入一个新的洞穴系统之前，你可以选择你想带的装备。您可以选择其他运动方法（如抓钩）或额外的光源，如头灯或灯笼。也许您宁愿随身携带浮潜，以便您可以到达洞穴的水下部分？或者也许是一把信号枪，可以轻松照亮远处的事物。有许多不同的工具可供选择！您可以使用独特的传送系统探索洞穴，在那里您扔出一个小型“传送灯”，您将被传送到它着陆的地方。这盏灯会在你身后留下一条前灯的痕迹，从而形成一条光的痕迹，引导你回到你来时的路！就像探洞者在前进时会在身后留下一根绳子一样，你的传送器会留下一根电线和光迹，让你原路返回。另一个运动选项是一对探洞钩，您可以使用它来在环境中自由“抓取和移动”自己！选择作为“体验”或“游戏”进行游戏。选择“体验”将允许您从一开始就选择您想要的任何装备，然后随心所欲地探索洞穴，而选择“游戏”将包括一个进度系统，您从基本工具开始，必须在洞穴中搜索更多。它还采用了一个简单的货币系统，您可以在其中使用洞穴中发现的各种宝石来获得更好的工具！您还可以玩一系列特殊的 “场景”，以独特的方式改变游戏玩法。例如，您可以探索被水淹没的洞穴系统，从另一个入口开始游戏，或者只用荧光棒玩游戏！有些场景就像特殊挑战，比如开始游戏时已经深入到一个洞穴系统中，只有一根蜡烛（蜡烛会随着时间的推移而耗尽！您还会在 Echo Grotto 找到一系列居住在洞穴中的生物。留意蜗牛、鳗鱼和鳗鱼！但是，如果您不喜欢令人毛骨悚然的爬行动物，您可以随时设置在洞穴中可以找到哪些动物（甚至根本找不到）。亲眼看看 Echo Grotto 洞穴深处有什么吧！,"Echo Grotto is a virtual reality experience that lets you explore unique and intricate cave systems using a range of caving gear and tools! Traverse underwater tunnels, huge open caverns, crystal caves, massive ravines, sulfur pools, deep pits, glow-worm lit grottos and much more! Echo Grotto uses subtle random generation to make every cave system feel unique, while still delivering amazing locations and deeply interconnected caves since every cavern and passage is handmade and uniquely designed. Each time you embark down into the caves of Echo Grotto you will never know what’s around the corner! Before you descend into a new cave system you can choose what gear you want to take with you. You might choose another locomotion method (like a grappling hook) or maybe an additional light source like a headlamp or lantern. Maybe you would rather take a snorkel with you so that you can reach the underwater portions of the caves? Or maybe a flare gun to easily light up things in the distance. There are many different tools to choose from! You can explore the caves using a unique teleportation system, where you throw a small ‘teleporter lamp’ and you will be teleported to where it lands. This lamp will leave a trail of previous lamps behind you, resulting in a trail of lights that leads you back the way you came! Much like how cavers would leave a string behind them as they go, your teleporters leave a wire and trail of lights for you to retrace your steps. Another locomotion option is a pair of caving hooks, which you can use to freely 'grab and move' yourself around the environment! Choose to play as either an 'experience' or a 'game'. Choosing 'experience' will allow you to pick whatever gear you want from the start and simply explore the caves as you wish, while choosing 'game' will include a progression system, where you start with only basic tools and must search for more within the caves. It also employs a simple currency system, where you can use various gemstones found within the caves to get better tools! You can also play a range of special ‘scenarios’ which alter the gameplay in unique ways. For example, you can explore a flooded cave system, start the game from an alternative entrance or play with nothing but glowsticks! Some scenarios are like special challenges, like starting the game already deep into a cave system with only a candle (which will run out over time!). You will also find a range of cave-dwelling creatures in Echo Grotto. Keep an eye out for snails, eels and wetas! But if you’re not a fan of creepy-crawlies you can always set which animals can be found in the caves (or even none at all). Go and see for yourself what’s deep in the caves of Echo Grotto!","“我从这些洞穴中带出的回忆比我在大多数其他 VR 游戏中带走的还要多......这是一个很好的例子,说明了 VR 的真正意义。8/10 – UploadVR",“I carried more memories out of these caves than I have done in most other VR games ...

This is a war game, so the word should be 'visceral' or something. Models are hugely detailed for an RTS, physics implemented impressively and so on. But relevantly, it's a functional sort of beauty (or - er - viscerality).” 10/10 – Eurogamer “Company of Heroes should be on the must-play list of every RTS fanatic out there, even those tired of WWII settings. It's just that good.” 9.6/10 – PC Gamer “The transformation from a idyllic little town into a heap of crushed buildings and burned out husks of vehicles can be shocking. Seeing and hearing major explosions that cause bodies (and bits of bodies) to fly across the screen along with rubble from a nearby building simply puts you more into the battle than any RTS in memory.” 9.4/10 – IGN"

Turbo Overkill,Turbo Overkill,"「《Turbo Overkill》是近年来最棒的《托尼?霍克》类游戏。」——Fanbyte
「若山姆?雷米的《鬼玩人》让链锯臂成了标志性武器，那等着看这条链锯腿吧。」——Sportskeeda
「《Turbo Overkill》不仅是当下最棒的复古射击游戏之一 —— 这简直是市面上最棒的游戏，没有之一。」——Superjumpmagazine.com
半人半机械，全是杀戮机器
深受《毁灭战士》《雷神之锤》与 Apogee《毁灭公爵 3D》等经典启发，搭配震撼赛博朋克视觉效果，《Turbo Overkill》是 Apogee 迄今最 savage 的 FPS。你将扮演强尼?涡轮，体内植入隐藏手臂火箭，小腿可伸出链锯，滑动时将敌人拦腰斩断。
在这个《银翼杀手》遇上《DOOM》的地狱景象中，强尼返回故乡「天堂城」，却发现全城居民被 rogue AI「Syn」及其机械军团控制。为筹钱摆脱过去的错误，强尼接下不可能的任务：摧毁史上最强 AI。敌对赏金猎人也想抢先夺奖 —— 在天堂城，万事皆难。
涡轮时间、墙跑、冲刺与钩爪，我的天！
《Turbo Overkill》将「过火」玩到前所未有的高度：激活「涡轮时间」（一种带 twist 的全新慢动作），通过墙跑与冲刺积累惊人速度；用链锯腿滑行，撕裂敌人并对 Boss 造成暴击；甚至站在飞行车引擎盖上「冲浪」。
可使用双持麦格农（自动锁定并瞬杀多名敌人）、霰弹枪（附带榴弹发射器）或「传送 frag 步枪」（将强尼传送至敌人体内，再从内部引爆）。穿越二十余张布满秘密的关卡、奖励竞技场与白刃战谜题，寻找改变游戏规则的收藏品，解锁三倍怪物速度、即死等惩罚性 modifier。结合强尼的所有武器与能力，智胜、击溃并跑赢腐化军团。
划重点：
击杀 Boss 获得其强化（特殊能力）
用钩爪玩出「蜘蛛侠」操作
用链锯滑斩踢，比《毁灭公爵》更狂
击杀 = 现金，用现金安装强化、升级武器、在天赋树解锁新能力

「作为用《德军总部 3D》《三角州崛起》《毁灭公爵 3D》《马克思?佩恩》《猎物》开创射击游戏类型的人，自 Apogee/3D Realms 黄金时代以来，我从未对一款 FPS 如此兴奋，」创始人斯科特?米勒写道，「《Turbo Overkill》是乐趣与原创玩法的沙盒，像热融披萨配冰爽啤酒般完美融合。玩这款游戏让我再次成为『涡轮爱好者』。」","' Turbo Overkill is the best Tony Hawk game in years.' - Fanbyte 'If Sam Raimi's Evil Dead movie made the Chainsaw Arm an iconic piece of weaponry, wait till you see the leg chainsaw.' - Sportskeeda 'Turbo Overkill isn't just one of the best boomer shooters on the market right now - this is one of the best games on the market, full stop.' - Superjumpmagazine.com Half-metal, half-human, all murder machine Heavily inspired by some of the all-time greats like Id's Doom &amp; Quake , and Apogee's Duke Nukem 3D , with stunning cyberpunk visuals, Turbo Overkill is the most savage FPS ever released by Apogee. You play as Johnny Turbo, augmented with hidden arm rockets and a chainsaw that extends from your lower leg allowing you to slide-slice enemies wide open. In this Blade Runner -meets- DOOM hellscape, Johnny returns to his hometown of Paradise and finds its entire population possessed by Syn, a rogue AI, and its army of augmented minions. Desperate for enough money to outrun his past mistakes, Johnny takes on the impossible job of destroying the greatest AI ever created. Rival bounty hunters want to claim the prize first. Nothing is easy in paradise. Turbo Time, wall-running, dashing and grappling hooks, oh my Turbo Overkill takes over-the-top to never-before-reached heights. Activate Turbo Time(?), a new form of slow motion with a twist. Build incredible speed by wall-running and dashing. Slide on your chainsaw leg, eviscerating foes and opening up bosses for critical damage, and go car-surfing on the hoods of flying cars. Blast away with the Twin Magnums, which lock-on and instagib several foes, the Boomer Shotgun and its attached grenade launcher, or the Telefragger sniper rifle, which teleports Johnny inside an enemy before they explode from within. Race through two dozen stages packed with secrets, bonus arena stages, and white-knuckle combat puzzles. Find game-changing collectibles to unlock punishing modifiers like triple-monster-speed and insta-kill. Combine all of Johnny’s weapons and powers to outsmart, outgun and outrun the corrupted legions. TL;DR: o Kill a boss, get its augment (special power) o Play Spider-Man with your grappling hook o One-up Duke Nukem with your chainsaw slide-slice kick o Kills = cash. Use cash to install augments, upgrade your weapons, and add new abilities in your talent tree o Be a ghost runner while wall running o Attack from above riding the hood of your flying car like a kung-furious badass o Mini-rockets built into your robotic arm? ? o This. List. Will. Grow. Wishlist the game to see it happen Don't quote us on nuthin' “ Turbo Overkill is fast, frenetic and ferocious—excess personified,” said Sam Prebble, one half of Trigger Happy Interactive. “This is the game we’ve always wanted to play; making it is a dream project. Relentless enemies, extremely deadly and fun weapons, speed and precision above all else—if you love Quake III Arena , modern and classic DOOM , or Apogee’s legendary first-person shooters, you’ll feel right at home in Paradise.” “As the guy who helped launch the shooter genre with Wolfenstein 3D , Rise of the Triad, Duke Nukem 3D, Max Payne , and Prey , I haven’t been this excited about an FPS since the golden era of Apogee/3D Realms,” wrote Scott Miller, founder. “ Turbo Overkill is a sandbox of fun and original gameplay ideas that come together like a night of melty hot pizza and your favorite cold, frothy brew.

矮人之塔,Dwarf Tower,Dwarf Tower 是一款建塔和施法的回合制战术游戏。每个回合你都通过放置方块、建造房间和施展各种法术来发展你的塔。你的塔可以有图书馆（储存法术）、水晶（产生法力）、矮人住宅（给你矮人来修理塔）和一些其他房间。关键的房间是大法师的房间。它的位置对敌人是隐藏的，你必须不惜一切代价保护它，否则你会输。房间方案非常重要：你把它放得越高，它就越强大。较高的塔比较低的塔具有巨大的优势。但要小心雷击！它可以引发一场大火，在几个回合内摧毁整个塔，因此请让矮人消防员做好准备。有些房间在地下工作得更好，但有洪水的风险！游戏比赛的总体目标是通过粉碎、焚烧或淹没敌人的大法师房间来摧毁它。然而，这并不那么简单，因为敌人会尽最大努力同时摧毁你的大法师！该游戏具有与电脑对战的单人模式以及多人游戏模式。你现在可以挑战你的朋友。想想 Sea Battle，混合了一些 Worms 的乐趣，以及 Faster Than Light 房间管理。添加来自 Kevin MacLeod 的精美像素艺术图形、动画和美妙的音乐。,"Dwarf Tower is a turn-based tactics game of tower building and spellcasting. Each turn you develop your tower by placing blocks, constructing rooms, and play various spells.

It's position is hidden from enemy and you must protect it at all costs, or you will lose. Room scheme is very important: the higher you place it, the more powerful it gets. Higher tower gets tremendous advantage over the lower one. But beware of Lightning strike! It can start a fire that will destroy the whole tower in several turns, so keep Dwarf Firefighters ready. Some rooms work much better underground, but there is a risk of flood! The overall goal of the game match is to destroy the enemy's Archmage's Chambers by crushing, burning or flooding it. It's not that simple however, because enemy will do his best to destroy your Archmage at the same time! The game features single player mode against the computer as well as multiplayer mode.

弹幕无限3,Danmaku Unlimited 3,弹幕无限3：受经典日本射击游戏启发，弹幕无限3是一款精心制作的日本弹幕游戏最佳元素的大杂烩，全部包装在一个精致、易于上手的包装中。老式射击游戏？为什么值得我花时间？弹幕游戏风格的机制因其在许多热门独立游戏中的加入而正在经历一种复兴。然而，如果玩家想更深入地探索弹幕游戏的世界，许多传统游戏可能难以理解其机制，或者对于新手来说太难上手。弹幕无限3旨在为不熟悉该类型的玩家提供直观且易于上手的体验，同时又不失该类型令人兴奋的激烈和华丽。那么，这款游戏是如何做到的呢？核心弹幕游戏中的一项重要功能是，只有玩家飞船的中心部分——核心，才易受到敌人火力的攻击。擦边当核心靠近子弹时，只要轻轻“擦过”它们，就可以为玩家的飞船充电。一旦完全充电，就可以释放强大的狂暴，让你感觉自己像个真正的老板。精神/擦边系统击落敌人会将其子弹转化为无害的幽灵子弹，玩家可以安全地触摸它们，同时为飞机充电。所有这些都使得游戏的挑战水平对于各种水平的玩家来说都是可以管理的，而不会将游戏变成一个没有子弹的火鸡射击游戏。我擅长弹幕射击游戏，我不会轻易通关，对吧？游戏有两种独特的模式，擦边模式具有不同的调整系统（触发幽灵子弹的条件），提供了与最传统的弹幕游戏一样高的挑战水平。有故事吗？这是一个关于守护地球的守护者反抗她的监管者的故事。虽然它不是莎士比亚的作品，但你来这里是为了子弹和爆炸，对吧？音乐怎么样？没有好音乐的射击游戏是不完整的！音乐由来自日本的BLANKFIELD制作，他制作了许多《东方》以及其他动漫/游戏音乐的精彩混音！还有别的吗？活动包含5个阶段，每个阶段都以一场史诗般的多阶段首领战结束。玩家可以解锁并尝试多达25种武器组合，以找到最适合自己的组合。独特的渲染技术可以实时程序化地动画化精灵。支持TATE模式，供使用垂直屏幕的玩家使用。或者，如果你喜欢侧躺着玩，我不会告诉你该怎么过你的生活。好吧，我说服了！（或者没有，如果是这样的话，感谢你读到这里！）,"What's it about Inspired by classic Japanese shooting games, Danmaku Unlimited 3 is a lovingly crafted medley of the best aspects of Japanese bullet hell games, all in a polished, accessible package. An old school shoot'em up? Why is it worth my time? Bullet hell style mechanics is having a kind of renaissance with its inclusion in many hit indie games. However if players want to explore more into the world of Bullet Hell a lot of traditional titles can be hard to understand in its mechanics or just plain too difficult to get into as a newcomer. Danmaku Unlimited 3 is designed to be intuitive and accessible to players unfamiliar with the genre, all the while without losing any of the intensity and flashiness that makes the genre so exciting to play. Okay, so how does the game do that? CORE A staple feature in Bullet Hells, only the very center of the player's craft, the core, is vulnerable to enemy fire. GRAZING Get the core close to bullets to just barely 'graze' it will power up the player's craft. Once fully charged it can unleash a powerful rampage that makes you feel like a total boss. SPIRIT/GRAZE SYSTEM Shooting down enemies turns their shots into harmless ghost bullets that the player can safely touch while also powering up the plane. All of this allows the game to be at a level of challenge that is manageable for a wide range of players without reducing the game into a bullet free turkey shoot. I'm good at bullet hell shooters, won't I just breeze though the game then? The game has two unique modes, GRAZE MODE features a differently tuned system (with conditions to trigger the ghost bullets) that offers a higher level of challenge comparable to the toughest traditional bullet hell titles. Is there a story? It is about a guardian, entrusted with Earth, rebelling against her overseers. Shakespeare it isn't, but you are here for the bullets and explosions right? How is the music? A Shmup is nothing without good music! Music is by BLANKFIELD from Japan, who does awesome remixes of Touhou and many other anime/game musics! Anything else? The campaign features 5 stages each ending with an epic multi-stage boss fight. Up to 25 weapon combinations for players to unlock and experiment to find what works best for them. Unique rendering technique that procedurally animate sprites on the fly. TATE support for players that use vertical screens. Or if you like to play lying down on your sides, I'm not going to tell you how to live your life. Okay I'm sold! (Or not, if so then thanks for making it down to here!","“精通现代 shmup。”9/10 – GameSkinny “该类型的水印,粉丝们不应该错过它。”9/10 – 值得一玩 “弹幕无限 3 是视觉杰作。”8/10 – 被压倒的菜鸟","“Mastery of the modern day shmup.” 9/10 – GameSkinny “A watermark in the genre, and fans shouldn't miss it.” 9/10 – Worthplaying “Danmaku Unlimited 3 is a visual masterpiece.” 8/10 – Overpowered Noobs"

静物2,Still Life 2,谁躲在 X 先生的背后？静物 2 揭示了期待已久的静物结局，并预示着对特工维多利亚·麦克弗森的新调查。2008 年秋天，维多利亚被送到缅因州，在那里刚刚发现了艾伦·邓尼根 （Ellen Dunnigan） 的尸体。作案手法和发送给警方和媒体的视频让他们对凶手的身份毫不怀疑：东海岸酷刑犯又来袭了！尸检过程中没有发现任何线索，因为连环杀手煞费苦心地清洗了尸体。再一次，杀手没有犯下任何错误。在她的汽车旅馆房间里，维多利亚看到了帕洛玛·埃尔南德斯 （Paloma Hernandez） 的一篇报道，这位记者报道了所有带有东海岸酷刑犯签名的罪行。埃尔南德斯一直对联邦调查局和维多利亚州缺乏进展持强烈批评态度。这并没有阻止埃尔南德斯打电话要求维多利亚在当晚晚些时候见她。埃尔南德斯声称她掌握了一些关于凶手的所谓线索。维多利亚断然拒绝。片刻之后，帕洛玛被酷刑者绑架了......Still Life 2 仍然忠于其第一部分的精神，但现在允许您扮演和管理两个受相同命运束缚的角色。这一次，目标是控制两个女主角，从两个互补的角度看游戏，体验两种不同的游戏玩法。根据您是扮演被凶手追捕的受害者 Paloma Hernandez，还是追踪他的 FBI 特工 Victoria McPherson，您可以在生存和调查之间交替。,"Who is hiding behind Mr. X? Still Life 2 reveals the long-awaited ending of Still Life and spells a new investigation for Agent Victoria McPherson. In Fall 2008, Victoria is sent to Maine where Ellen Dunnigan's body has just been found. The modus operandi and the video sent to the police and press leave them in no doubt as to the killer's identity: the East Coast Torturer has struck again! No clues are picked up during the autopsy, as the serial killer painstakingly washed the body. Once again, the killer has not committed any errors. From her motel room, Victoria comes across a report by Paloma Hernandez, the journalist covering all the crimes bearing the East Coast Torturer's signature. Hernandez has been highly critical of the FBI's and Victoria's lack of progress. That does not stop Hernandez from phoning and asking Victoria to meet her later that evening. Hernandez claims to have some so-called clues on the killer in her possession. Victoria flatly refuses. Just moments later, Paloma is kidnapped by the Torturer… Still Life 2 remains true to the spirit of its first installment, but now allows you to play and manage two characters bound by the same fate. This time, the aim is to control two heroines, see the game from two complementary viewpoints and experience two different gameplays. Depending on whether you are playing Paloma Hernandez, the victim being hunted by the killer or Victoria McPherson, the FBI agent tracking him down, you can alternate between survival and investigation.","“它吸引你,让你经历痛苦,然后把你吐出来” 91% – JustAdventure “一款经过深思熟虑的游戏,有很多动作” 83% – AceGamez","“It draws you in, puts you through the wringer and then spits you out” 91% – JustAdventure “A well thought out game with lots of action” 83% – AceGamez"

永恒之线,Eternal Threads,《Eternal Threads》是一款第一人称、单人剧情向的时间操控解谜游戏。你将扮演时空修复员，前往2015年英国北部，调查一起造成六人死亡的火灾。你无法阻止火灾本身，但可以反复修改火灾前一周住户们的关键选择，改变他们的命运。你可以自由浏览整周时间线，调整事件顺序、观察因果变化，通过多种路径让每个人幸存，并探索最佳结局。游戏强调“选择与后果”，每次改变都会重塑未来。,"Eternal Threads is a single-player, first-person story-driven puzzle game of time manipulation, choice and consequence. As an operative tasked with fixing corruption in the timestream, you have been sent to the North of England in May 2015, where six people died in a house fire. Prohibited from simply stopping the fire, you must instead manipulate the choices made by the housemates in the week leading up to it so that they all survive the event. From the outset, you have free and complete reign to explore the seven day timeline before the fire. You can watch and alter the significant events from the entire week as many times as you like and in whatever order you wish. Some decisions will have only minor effects on the timeline, moving objects around the house or revealing deeper stories and secrets. Major changes however, rewrite the timeline by changing existing events, adding new events and even replacing other events entirely. You must traverse up and down this timeline, changing decisions at different moments throughout the week so that their effects interact and combine together to save all six housemates. However, it is not just the housemates who have choices. Each of them can be saved from the fire in multiple ways, with each outcome having a profound effect on their lives in the future. Will you just search for the quickest and easiest solution, or can you find the best possible outcome for everyone? Ultimately, everything is about choices and consequences. Features Choose how you want to follow the game’s story The complete narrative follows the six main characters through multiple decisions across multiple timelines and you can experience these in any way you choose. You can concentrate on just one particular character’s storyline at a time, following their choices across the timelines and then go back to the start and follow another character. You can approach the story like a forensic detective, observe the final outcomes of the story and then work backwards along the timeline – essentially observing the effects and then determining their cause. Or you can just watch things in chronological order, experiencing the timeline unfold as you observe and change the decisions that the characters face as the week progresses. Watch and change things as many times as you like Can’t remember exactly what happened in an event? Changed a decision and you’re not sure you like the consequences? That’s fine. Just pop back along the timeline and watch and change whatever you like, whenever you like, as many times as you like. Change the past to affect the future Setting up temporary base in the house mere hours after the fire, provides a unique perspective on events. As you look back through the timeline, past events play out in front of you in ghostly form, with the smoke and fire damaged house a constant reminder of what is to come. In addition, as you manipulate the past, the environment can be reset around you to match the changes taking place. Some new objects will appear, others will move around the house and the contents of rooms can change substantially as you change the past.","“这是一部非凡的故事作品,经过专业编写和制作,将平凡与未来交织在一起,创造出令人难以置信的引人入胜的作品。你不会想放下它,一旦你完成了,你会在接下来的几周内考虑它。这确实是一件特别的事情“ 10/10 – GameSpew ”Eternal Threads 是叙事游戏迷的必玩之作。“8/10 – Cultured Vultures ”一个令人毛骨悚然的高潮,让所有的时间篡改都是值得的。”7/10 – 边缘","“This is a remarkable piece of storytelling, expertly written and crafted, weaving together the ordinary and the futuristic to create something incredibly compelling.

Highway Blossoms,Highway Blossoms,"Highway Blossoms 是一部以美国西南部为背景的短篇尤里动感小说。在发现了一位古老的淘金热矿工的日记后，据说详细记录了他藏匿的部分藏匿处，随着潜在的探矿者试图解决其线索并挖掘出财富，一场全国性的热潮开始了。Amber 不在乎。她开着一辆新继承的房车在沙漠中徘徊，哀悼失去祖父——她无动于衷，对周围发生的狩猎活动一无所知。直到她遇到了在新墨西哥州迷路的年轻搭便车者玛丽娜，女孩们才被卷入匆忙中。至少几十个单词，甚至几百个单词。虽然最后一个字数约为 90,000 字，但预计需要 6 小时左右的阅读时间。美国西部实际地标的宏伟手绘景观，全部采用绚丽的 1080p 细节。一个巨大的配乐，收录了 Smoke Thief、Jake Abernathie、Able Kirby 和团队其他朋友的作品。在您的 in-dash 盒式磁带播放器上听起来很舒服。几天的辅助功能选项，包括在不到 5 分钟的时间内跳过所有内容的能力。但谁会愿意这样做呢？成就，尽管老实说，它们可能扩展了“成就”的定义。将 2 次通读的愚蠢内容替代出来，这些内容是由程序员编写的，几乎没有监督。这可能是一个好主意，也可能不是一个好主意。","Highway Blossoms is a short yuri kinetic novel set in the American Southwest. After an old gold rush miner's journal is discovered, supposedly detailing where he hid parts of his stash, a nationwide craze begins as would-be prospectors try to solve its clues and strike it rich. Amber couldn't care less. Wandering the desert in a recently-inherited motorhome, she mourns the loss of her grandfather - indifferent and unaware of the hunt happening around her. It's not until she meets Marina, a young hitchhiker lost in New Mexico that the girls get swept up in the rush. At least tens of words, maybe even hundreds. Although the last word count puts it around 90,000, so expect 6 or so hours of reading. Grand, hand-painted vistas of actual landmarks in the western United States, all in glorious 1080p detail. A huge soundtrack featuring the works of Smoke Thief, Jake Abernathie, Able Kirby, and other friends of the team. Sounds right at home on your in-dash cassette tape player. Accessibility options for days, including the ability to skip through everything in less than five minutes. But who would wanna do that? Achievements, although to be honest, they might be stretching the definition of 'achievement.' Alternate silly content for second readthroughs that was written by the programmer with little to no oversight. This may or may not have been a good idea.","“角色都很讨人喜欢（无论如何都是这些）,表现是一流的,淘金热和公路旅行方面非常有趣,Amber X Marina 的爱情故事很暖心。强烈推荐给想要体验特别事物的 yuri 粉丝。很棒 – The Yuri Nation“AlienWorks [是] 未来值得关注的开发商。”4/5 – 铁杆游戏玩家“进入 Highway Blossoms,我不确定会发生什么。尽管如此,没过多久,我就把时间托付给了角色,享受他们所经历的身体和情感之旅。3.5/5 – 我们搞定了","“The characters are all likable (the ones meant to be anyway), the presentation is top notch, the gold rush and road trip aspects are very enjoyable and Amber X Marina’s love story is heartwarming.

NaissanceE,NaissanceE,NaissanceE 是一款晦涩而神奇的第一人称探索游戏，是一次哲学之旅，也是一次艺术体验。冒险发生在一个原始、神秘的结构中，游戏主要包括探索和感受这个非时空世界的深刻而强烈的氛围，但平台和解谜区域也将丰富体验。游戏沿着一条线性路径构建，其间穿插着更多可供自由探索的开阔区域、一些需要解决的谜题和一些更多的实验序列。在“Naissance”世界的原始区域中越走越深，玩家会遇到实体或机械系统。无论这些实体是生命形式还是纯粹的机器，它们都会对玩家的存在、光和影做出反应，并且可能会打开对以下内容的访问。如果旅程的大部分部分只需要好奇心和逻辑，那么对跑步、呼吸和跳跃动作的良好控制和协调将有助于完成罕见但紧急的序列，作为对老式 die an retry 游戏的致敬。游戏背后的主要思想是让玩家欣赏孤独，欣赏迷失在巨大未知宇宙中的感觉，并被这个世界的美丽所惊叹。一个似乎是活生生的世界，引导玩家，纵他，并以任何理由与他玩耍。想象力是享受和理解 NaissanceE 的重要钥匙。行走在一个未被发现的抽象结构中，会带来关于这个世界的本质、关于这次旅行的意义的问题。这些建筑和事件具有唤起和象征意义，将引导玩家的想象力找到答案，如果它只是重要的话。NaissanceE 由 Limasse Five 开发，作曲家 Pauline Oliveos 、 Patricia Dallio 和 Thierry Zaboitzeff 参与其中。警告！不建议癫痫患者使用此游戏。,"NaissanceE is an obscure and magical first person exploration game, a philosophical trip and an artistic experience. The adventure takes place in a primitive mysterious structure and the game mainly consists to explore and feel the deep and strong ambiance of this atemporal world but platforming and puzzles areas will also enrich the experience. The game is constructed along a linear path punctuated by more open areas to freely explore, some puzzles to solves and some more experimental sequences. Going deeper and deeper in a primitive zone from “Naissance” world, the player will meet entities or mechanical systems. Whether those entities are life forms or pure machines, they react to player presence, to light and shadow and they may open access to the following. If most parts of the journey will require only curiosity and logic, a good control and coordination on running, breathing and jumping actions will help to go through rare but exigent sequences, as an homage to old school die an retry games. The main idea behind the game is to make the player appreciate the loneliness, the feeling to be lost in a gigantic unknown universe and to be marvelled by the beauty of this world. A world which seems to be alive, leading the player, manipulating him and playing with him for any reason. Imagination is an important key to enjoy and understand NaissanceE. Walking in an undiscovered abstract structure brings questions about the nature of this world, about the meaning of this trip. Evocating and symbolic, the architecture and events will lead player’s imagination to find an answer, if it only matters.

太阳系交易商,Sol Trader,《Sol Trader》是克里斯・帕森斯推出的独立单人游戏，这是一款打破类型界限的太空模拟游戏，其核心并非你知晓什么 —— 而是你认识谁。在《Sol Trader》中，你交易的不仅是货物，还包括飞船、组件、矿产、人情、人脉和信息。游戏结合了俯视视角 2D 太空飞行与对人脉网络的策略操控，单人模式下，你将利用家人和朋友在政府或商业领域的关系执行任务。游戏开始时不会给你任何飞船：你必须贷款租用飞船，或向富有的亲戚借用。在行星间飞行，与你在城市和太空中遇到的各种角色互动，通过与朋友和亲戚聊天来调查其他角色的信息，用更好的枪支、引擎、超光速驱动器和客舱定制你的飞船，通过贸易货物获利。游戏会程序生成由数千个随机角色组成的完整社会，每局新游戏都从你角色的出生开始，随着成长，你将选择父母和所有重大人生选择，这些选择决定你的性格以及你的朋友、亲戚和敌人。游戏支持完全模组化：可修改所有组织、事件、武器、行星、飞船、对话和教程系统。每个新游戏都已拥有两百年的历史，游戏生成时，数千个随机角色诞生、生活、死亡，每次都创造出完全独特的社会。开始新游戏时，你从角色的出生阶段介入，选择父母并在成长过程中做出所有重大人生选择，这些选择决定你的性格、朋友、亲戚、商业伙伴和敌人。游戏没有固定剧情，而是生成数千个角色、事件和互动来搭建场景：作为玩家，你在游戏开始前就已出生在这个世界并形成人际关系，随后可在这个世界中创造自己的传奇 —— 探索已知（和未知）的太阳系、交易货物、执行任务、利用人脉，并按你认为合适的方式为家族成员复仇。这款游戏拥有复杂的程序历史生成器，灵感源自《矮人要塞》的冒险和传奇模式，每个新游戏都已历经两百年，在你存在之前就充满了角色出生、生活和死亡的鲜活历史。当你在这个世界中创建角色时，将面临与所有电脑控制市民相同的选择，角色早期生活中的决定设定了你的初始技能和属性，以及家庭关系和商业人脉。游戏宇宙延伸至我们当前太阳系的遥远区域，在某些地区旅行非常不安全：已知海盗常在主要星门附近出没。你将能够购买各种飞船，甚至可以同时拥有多艘，飞船可根据船体设计安装各种设备，包括更好的枪支、超光速驱动器和引擎。旅途中难免会遭受损伤，你可以找遇到的机械师修理飞船，与优秀的机械师交朋友，当你从木卫二运水任务中半残归来时，这将带来截然不同的结果…… 关键不在于你知道什么…… 你降落在伦敦太空港，立即前往市场，看看老熟人凯莱布・丘利是否仍会给你的货物一个好价钱。在卸载钛货物时，通过与凯莱布聊天发现他需要将一个包裹送到金星的维康。路途有点远，但你知道那里目前缺水，所以你买了小飞船能装下的所有水。凯莱布感激你送包裹，所以货物卖了个好价钱。离开时顺道去了酒吧，发现最近有人在维康见过雷切尔・霍尔登，你一直想追踪她，因为当地犯罪集团让你随时告知她的行踪，这次短途旅行正好成为处理未了事务的完美借口。你在考虑是否带乘客去维康，你的飞船尚未安装客舱，但值得看看谁想走。在当地酒店找到三个急切想走的人：急切得近乎反常，他们愿意支付远超正常的运费，这意味着离开地球安全区后可能会有人跟踪。这是个风险，但你确实需要钱…… 而且其中一位乘客是查尔斯・赫克勒的儿子，你很想结识他……,"A solo indie title from Chris Parsons, Sol Trader is a genre-busting space simulation where it's not about what you know - it's who you know. In Sol Trader you trade not only goods but ships, components, minerals, favours, contacts and information too. Single-player combination of top down 2D spaceflight and strategic manipulation of your network of contacts Run missions using your family and friends' connections to government or business No ship given to you at game start: you must take a loan and hire a ship, or borrow one from a wealthy relative Fly between planets, interacting with the various characters you come across in cities and in space Research information on other characters through chatting to friends and relatives Customise your ship with better guns, engines, hyperdrives and passenger cabins Trade goods for profit Procedural generation of a whole society of thousands of random characters Start every new game from your character's birth Choose your parents and all your major life choices as you grow up Your choices determine your personality and your friends, relatives and enemies Full modding support: change all the organisations, events, weapons, planets, ships, conversations and tutorial system. 200 years of characters Each new game is already two centuries old. Thousands of random characters are born, live and die as the game is generated, creating totally unique societies each time. When starting a new game you do so from your character's birth, choosing your parents and all your major life choices as you grow up. Your choices determine your personality, your friends, relatives, business contacts and your enemies. There is no set story. The game generates thousands of characters, events and interactions to set the scene: as a player, you are born into this world and form relationships in it before the game starts. You’ll then be able to create your own legend within this world: explore the known (and unknown) solar system, trade goods, run missions, leverage your contacts, and avenge members of your family as you see fit. This game features a complex procedural history generator, inspired by the adventure and legends mode in Dwarf Fortress. Each new game is already two centuries old, with a living history full of characters that are born, live and die before you even exist. When you create a character in this world, you face the same choices as all the computer-controlled citizens did. The decisions you make in your character’s early life set your starting skills and attributes, and your family connections and business contacts. The game universe stretches to the far reaches of our current solar system. In certain regions travel is very unsafe: pirates are known to hang out near the major gates. You'll be able to purchase a variety of ships and be able to own more than one at once. Ships can be fitted with a variety of equipment, including better guns, hyperdrives and engines, depending on what their hulls are designed to take. You will inevitably take damage and your ship can be repaired by mechanics that you will meet on your journey. Making friends with a good mechanic will make all the difference when you return half-alive from the Callisto water run... It's not what you know... You land at London's space port and immediately head to the market to see if an old contact of yours, Caleb Churley, will still give you a good deal on your cargo. Whilst offloading your titanium delivery, you discover through chatting to Caleb that he needs a parcel taking to Vikon on Venus. It's a bit of a distance, but you know they're short of water at the moment, so you buy all you can fit into your small ship. Caleb's grateful for the parcel delivery, so you get a good price on the cargo. You drop by the bar on the way out, and discover that Rachel Holden was seen in Vikon recently. You've been meaning to try and track her down, as you've been asked by the local crime syndicate to keep them up to date with her whereabouts. This little trip is turning into the perfect excuse to handle some unfinished business. You debate whether to take passengers to Vikon. Your ship isn't fitted with passenger cabins yet, but it's worth seeing who wants to go. In a local hotel you find three people keen to go: almost too keen. They're willing to pay way over the odds for transport, which means you're likely to have someone on your tail once you leave Earth's safe zone. It's a risk, but you could really do with the money... plus one of the passengers is the son of Charles Heckler, someone you'd love to get to know...","“Sol Trader 非常有趣,是必玩的游戏。”非常有偏见的评论 “一款具有令人惊讶的自由度和深度的游戏。”Gamewatcher：“嗯,值得一看。电子游戏年鉴",“Sol Trader is great fun and is a must-play.” Very Biased Reviews “A game of surprising freedom and depth.” Gamewatcher “Well worth a look.” The Video Game Almanac

TV189,TV189,TV189 是一款以反乌托邦近未来为背景的短动作游戏。TV189 由一位充满激情的独立游戏开发者创建，具有 9 个精心策划的关卡，旨在帮助玩家掌握直觉的艺术，因为他们的技能通过近距离战斗和基于解谜的游戏玩法受到考验。我相信玩家应该通过包含一个技能树来成为体验的中心：让你在力量和弹药能力之间进行选择。游戏通过配音过场动画、游戏内笔记和文档的混合，在一个广阔的、不断发展的情节中，讲述了一个详尽的故事。从在地下设施的停尸房中醒来到执行恢复/暗杀任务，TV189 利用了一系列以多样化用户体验为导向的游戏类型。探索地图会获得急需的弹药和发射器作为奖励。使用这些发射器来升级您的角色，以更有效地节省弹药或通过 15 种不同的技能来学习和解锁，以及 2 种最终的“大师能力”来更快地恢复健康。您在俄罗斯蒂马林的一次秘密行动中工作数月后，在停尸房中醒来。感染了一种新的神秘病毒，您的身体被隔离和收容以阻止疾病传播。俄罗斯前线部队 （RFF） 是一个独立的恐怖组织，用一种被称为“TV189”的神秘生物武器威胁要对世界舞台进行大规模毁灭性破坏。然而，他们不知道的是，您开发的免疫力意味着您可以进入 Timalyun 和其他 RFF 控制区域而不会有感染的危险。使用这种新建立的能力并得到几个联合国国家的支持，您必须执行一次隐身和匕首行动，从内部结束 RFF。从收回不来的现金和服务器到在暗杀任务中爬上大院的屋顶访问通风系统，TV189 呈现了各种关卡类型和风格，每个关卡都有自己的主题、地点和氛围。自抢先体验以来，TCG 一直在努力包含各种新功能来增强游戏;每个级别都进行了全面改革，添加了新的关卡，某些场景没有被删减，从而带来了精致的体验，包括： 拥有大量武器库的完整库存系统。技能树系统，允许专攻力量和弹药能力。动态关卡 ，危险可能无处不在。室内/室外场景，融合了远程和近距离战斗。,"TV189 is a short action game set in a dystopian near-future. Created by a passionate solo indie game developer, TV189 features 9 carefully curated levels designed to help the player master the art of intuition as their skills are put to the test with close-quarters combat as well as puzzle based gameplay . I believe the player should be in the centre of the experience by including a skill tree : giving you the choice between strength and ammunition abilities. The game features a thoroughly written story expressed through a mix of voice acted cutscenes , in-game notes &amp; documents in an expansive, constantly evolving plot . From waking up in a morgue at an underground facility to going on recovery/assassination missions, TV189 utilizes a range of gameplay types oriented around a variety-driven user experience . Exploration into the map is rewarded with much-needed ammunition and transmitters. Use these transmitters to upgrade your character either to conserve ammo more efficiently or regenerate health faster with 15 different skills to learn and unlock, with 2 final 'master abilities' . You wake up in a morgue months after working in a covert operation in Timalyun, Russia. Infected with a new mysterious virus, your body was isolated and contained to stop the disease from spreading. The Russian Front Force (R.F.F.) are a independent terrorist organisation threatening mass-destruction to the world stage with a mystery biological weapon dubbed 'TV189' . However, unbeknownst to them is that your developed immunity means you can enter Timalyun and other R.F.F. controlled areas without danger of infection. Using this new founded ability and backed by several UN nations you must execute a cloak-and-dagger operation to put an end to the R.F.F. from the inside . From repossessing ill-obtained cash and servers to climbing onto the roof of a compound to access the venting system in an assassination assignment , TV189 presents a variety of level types and styles, each with their own themes, locations and atmospheres . Since early access, TCG has worked hard to include a wide variety of new features to enhance the game; each level has received a complete overhaul , with new levels being added and certain scenes not making the cut leading to a refined experience including: Full Inventory System with a large arsenal of weapons. Skill Tree System which allows specializing in strength and ammunition abilities. Dynamic Levels , where danger may be around every corner. Indoor/Outdoor Scenes featuring a mix of long range &amp; close-quarters combat .","“一款坚实的独立游戏,具有 2000 年代的氛围、出色的射击机制、扎实的故事和非常有吸引力的价格。”OCG “你必须拯救世界免受病毒的细菌感染。但请记住,你不能相信任何人,因为即使是朋友也可能是叛徒。瘟疫医生","“A solid Indie game with 2000s vibes nice shooting mechanics a solid story and a very attractive price.” OCG “You must save the world from bacterial infection of the virus.

史莱姆的野心,Ambition of the Slimes,颠覆剧本的新型战术RPG游戏！史莱姆是 RPG 中最弱的敌人，有能力接管敌方单位并进行战斗！[摘要]这是一款战略性的回合制角色扮演游戏，但您控制的是史莱姆。史莱姆可以在战斗中接管敌人并控制他们。例如，史莱姆可以使用弓箭手，或者如果他们接管了魔法师，则可以使用魔法。如果他们接管了一个商人，他们甚至可以用贿赂来迷惑敌人。此外，还有各种史莱姆：其中一些可以扭曲。他们中的一些可以提高被附身的敌人的能力。还有更多...每个阶段都提出了关键的战略问题。你会对每个敌人使用哪种史莱姆？您将如何接管他们？例如，Slime 的元素对于捕获非常重要。这也是一场艰难的游戏，所以你不能通过鲁莽冲锋来获胜 - 战术至关重要。这款游戏的外表可能很轻松，但等待着您的是巨大的挑战！[故事]世界即将毁灭。残暴的人类到来，几乎占领了整个世界。他们焚烧森林，污染了水和天空。他们暴虐，几乎毁了这片土地。他们威胁着几乎没有抵抗的史莱姆;他们没有强大的力量，只是等待灭绝。然后史莱姆意识到他们可以接管人体并利用这种力量来对付他们的敌人。史莱姆的反击开始了。,"A new type of tactical RPG title that flips the script! Slimes, the weakest of RPG enemies, have the ability to take over enemy units and fight! [Summary] This is a strategic turn-based RPG, but it is Slimes that you control. Slimes can take over an enemy and control them in battle. For example, a Slime can utilise archers, or use magic if they take over a magician. They can even bewilder an enemy with a bribe if they take over a merchant. In addition there are various kinds of Slimes: Some of them can warp. Some of them can improve the abilities of the possessed enemy. And many more... Each stage poses key strategic questions. Which Slime will you use on each enemy? How will you take them over? For example the element of a Slime is very important for a capture. This is a tough game, too, so you cannot win by charging in recklessly - tactics are vital. The appearance of this game may be lighthearted, but a big challenge awaits! [STORY] The world was about to be ruined. The brutal humans arrived and almost took over the whole world. They burnt the forest, polluting the water and the sky. They were tyrannical, almost ruining the land. And they threatened the Slimes that offered little resistance; they did not have great power and merely waited for extinction. Then the Slimes realised they could take over the human bodies and use that strength against their enemies. The Slime counterattack began.","“Ambition Of The Slimes 颠覆了经典的回合制 RPG 公式,使您能够使用弱者来捕捉人类敌人并以一种有趣的新方式进行战斗。您可以使用的种类繁多的攻击、能力和技术使战斗真正令人兴奋。任天堂生活 “如果不出意外,真的没有其他东西能比得上 Ambition of the Slimes,实际上带领弱小、基本上毫无防备的单位参加战斗的概念是颠覆战术 RPG 的一种聪明方式,非常值得该类型的粉丝研究。”数字下载","“Ambition Of The Slimes throws the classic turn-based RPG formula on its head, enabling you to use the underdog to capture human enemies and battle in an interesting, new way. The large variety of attacks, abilities, and techniques available to you make the battles truly exciting.” Nintendo Life “If nothing else there is genuinely nothing else quite like Ambition of the Slimes, and the concept of actually leading weak, largely defenceless units into battle is such a clever way to flip the tactics RPG on its head that it’s well worth looking into for fans of the genre.” Digitally Downloaded"

王朝之争,Dynasty Feud,《王朝之争》：这是一款2-4人参与的竞技性、团队制、快节奏平台格斗游戏。你既可以本地游玩，也可以在线对战，展示你使用40个角色、一击必杀、多种战斗技能和大量风格的技巧。好吧，但这到底是什么意思呢？王朝之争与其他格斗游戏不同，它从多个类型中汲取灵感，提供了一种更快、更精简、更有趣的体验！在自由混战和团队比赛中，与其他王朝展开不同时代之间的终极对决。在全明星模式中定制你自己的王朝。在快速在线比赛中挑战其他玩家，或者在排名模式中登上巅峰。掌握目前可用的8个王朝的所有40个角色！在王朝之争中，你不会选择一个角色来战斗，而是选择一个由5个角色组成的王朝。这些角色就是你的生命条，如果你失去了他们全部，那就结束了，你完蛋了。什么，真的吗？不可能！而且他们死得很快，真的很快，非常非常快；一击之下这个角色就没了。是的，没了。下一个角色会出现，但它将是一个完全不同的角色，拥有自己的弱点和优势。珍惜你的角色，谨慎行动。了解他们的能力以及如何使用它们，与了解你的敌人一样重要。而且有40个这样的角色，所以……祝你玩得开心。一次错误的跳跃、一次意外的爆发或一次错过的攻击，都可能成为生死之间的分水岭。哦，这听起来很严肃。每个角色都是独一无二的。每个角色的玩法都不同。每个王朝都有其独特之处。从近战巨兽到狡猾的狙击手，再到隐形忍者和喜欢TNT的仙人掌，真正的王朝大师能够充分利用每个家庭成员来适应任何对手。让我们来看看他们都是谁吧……卡特赖特家族擅长长距离和中距离子弹攻击。他们的胜利关键在于利用他们的区域控制能力将敌人保持在远处。英灵家族是一个平衡的王朝，擅长非常强大的近战和有效的中距离投掷，以及良好的防御和机动性。凭借多种投射物、爆炸物和近战武器，花花公子团队是一个相当平衡的群体。猫山家族是游戏中最具机动性的王朝，同时拥有出色的近战能力。充分利用这两者的优势。乌尔格·阿阿格成员是一个混合群体，具有不错的投射物和中距离能力，以及一些强大的近战选项。他们很难控制，但一旦你掌握了他们，他们就非常强大。亚瑟家族是一个异常坚韧的王朝，其许多成员都拥有盾牌和盔甲。他们牺牲了机动性和射程。太阳之民的主要优势在于他们强大的超级争端攻击，在这种攻击中，每个角色都会获得特殊能力，同时他们能够通过牺牲自己来自动填满超级争端计量表。项目X-22受试者依赖于他们独特的心理力量机制。他们消耗心理能量进行攻击，然后需要重新充电。然而，如果他们储存了足够的心理能量，他们就可以承受一次打击。这可能是最难掌握的王朝。,"Dynasty Feud is a competitive, team-based, fast-paced platform brawler for 2-4 players. Play either local or online and show off your skills with 40 characters, one-hit kills, multiple fighting skills and a lot of style. OK, but... what does that mean? Well, Dynasty Feud is different from other brawlers out there, taking inspiration from several genres to offer an experience that is faster, leaner, and a lot of fun! Beat other dynasties in the ultimate battle between time periods in free-for-all and team matches. Customize your own dynasty in the ALL-STAR MODE. Challenge other players in quick ONLINE matches or rise to the top in RANKED MODE. Master all 40 CHARACTERS of the 8 DYNASTIES currently available! In Dynasty Feud you won’t pick a character to fight, you will pick a whole dynasty formed by 5 of them. The characters are your life bar, if you lose all of them, that’s it, you are done. What, really? No way! And they die fast, really fast, REALLY REALLY FAST; one hit and that character is gone. Yeah, gone. The next character will appear, but it will be a totally different one, with its own weaknesses and strengths. Value your characters and measure your movements carefully. Knowing their capacities and how to use them is as important as knowing your enemies. Plus there are 40 like this, so... have fun. A miscalculated jump, a surprise burst or missed attack can be the difference between death and glory. Uuuhh, that sounded serious. Each character is unique. Each character plays different. Each dynasty is special. From melee juggernauts to sneaky snipers, along with invisible ninjas and a TNT-loving cactus, a true Dynasty Master can adapt to any opponent by making the most of each of its family members. Let's see who they are shall we... The Cartwrongs are specialized in LONG and MEDIUM RANGE bullet attacks. Their key to victory is to keep enemies away by using their zoning abilities. The Yngling Clan is a well balanced dynasty that specializes in very strong MELEE and effective MEDIUM RANGE THROWS, as well as good defense and mobility. With a good mix of PROJECTILE, EXPLOSIVES and MELEE, the Fancier's Crew are a pretty balanced bunch. The Nekoyama-Shi is the most MOBILE dynasty in the game, with excellent MELEE aptitudes to boot. Take advantage of both. The Uurg Aaarg members are a mixed bunch with decent PROJECTILE and mid range capacity, as well as some powerful MELEE options. They are hard to control, but powerful once you master them. The House of Arthur is an exceptionally resilient dynasty, with many of its members having shield and armor. They do sacrifice mobility and reach. The People of the Sun's main strength is in their powerful SUPER FEUD attack, in which each character gains a special power, coupled with their ability to sacrifice themselves to automatically fill the SUPER FEUD meter. The Project X-22 subjects rely on their unique mind power mechanic. They spend mind energy to attack, which they then need to recharge. However, if they have enough mind energy saved up, they can withstand a hit. Probably the trickiest dynasty to master.","“Dynasty Feud 很酷。这真的很酷......一款与最好的新山丘之王相媲美的游戏。4/5 – 嘿,可怜的玩家 “已经很久没有像现在这样有趣的 4 人格斗体验了。”8/10 – Game Reactor “Dynasty Feud 是一款有趣而疯狂的平台格斗游戏,非常适合短时间的沙发游戏。”3.7/5 – Unigamesity",“Dynasty Feud is cool.

Fast and Low,Fast and Low,《Fast and Low》是一款结合战术射击与卡通风格的第一人称游戏，你将扮演警官Faust或Lo，在战火纷飞的城市中执行清剿任务，营救平民、制伏敌人。游戏包含16个精心设计的关卡，可单人游玩，也支持最多4人在线合作。支持VR与传统键鼠模式，并提供本地“非对称双人模式”（一个VR+一个PC玩家）玩法。,"Game Description In a city under fire, it’s up to Officer Faust and Officer Lo to clean up the streets. Play as Faust or Lo, or the rest of the police force, to breach-and-clear your way through 16 hand-crafted missions as you are tasked with neutralizing hostile threats and rescuing civilians. “Fast and Low” is a violent and intense tactical shooter that is depicted within a colorful and cartoonish setting. One of the key features of “Fast and Low” is that it can be played both in VR, or entirely using traditional FPS mouse/keyboard controls. Whereas the VR player will be able to physically peek around corners, and blind-fire from safety, FPS players are in turn given a wider array of tools and equipment. This game is best played in VR mode. Players can play through the missions solo (with their respective AI partner), locally via asymmetric multiplayer (1 VR Player + 1 FPS Player on the same PC), or engage in up to 4-player Online Multiplayer Co-op. Key Features Built from the ground up for room-scale Virtual Reality. Local Asymmetric Multiplayer. Online Multiplayer for up to 4 players! Game offers multiple forms of Free-locomotion (arm-swinging or touch-pad locomotion) and Snap/Smooth Rotation options.. These can be adjusted in the menu board. Realistic weapon handling! 13 Base Missions + 7 Bonus Missions (with more to come in future updates!) Base missions have bonus objectives that provide players with the opportunity to unlock new weapons and perks to further bolster their crime-stopping prowess Randomized enemy/civilian spawns to make each deployment feel different! Sandbox Mode: A game mode where you can replay unlocked missions and adjust the civilian/enemy density, modify your health pool, or experiment with different slow motion options! Fast and Low features locational-based damage for hostiles and civilians. Shoot a hostile's arm and you can disarm them. Shoot one of their leg's and you'll cripple them. Or shoot out both of their legs...and watch them fall helplessly to the ground. Each limb has it's own individual health bar...so there will never be a case where unloading a full clip on your target's foot will kill them. Ability to tone down the violence in the game. Character ' gibbing ' can be disabled entirely. What was the vision for Fast and Low? The vision of Fast and Low was to create a violent, and engaging tactical shooter, within a colorful cartoonish world. This was meant to be a somewhat difficult game akin to the old-school “SWAT” or “Rainbow Six” series. Enemies will be able to kill the player quickly within one or two bursts, but likewise, players can quickly dispatch targets with well-placed headshots. I also wanted a game where the guns felt strong and the shots felt impactful. Since the game is depicted in a cartoonish environment, it allows for a bit more creative freedom when it comes to the violence. One of the key features of Fast and Low is its ability to allow VR players to play locally with a buddy (via asymmetric multiplayer) on the same computer. I felt that there weren’t enough games currently in VR that allowed interaction between a VR player and the outside world. Who are the developers? Just myself!

Luxuria Superbia,Luxuria Superbia,一个关于触摸、愉悦和快乐的简单游戏。Luxuria Superbia 是一次丰富多彩的音乐之旅，让您充满欢乐。当您滑过俏皮的风格化花朵时，令人兴奋的设计从您的触摸中爆发出来。这一切都与体验和互动有关。有十二条花状的隧道和一个带寺庙的花园。在花园里，您可以通过转动拨盘来选择一朵花。当您完成一朵花时，下一朵花将被解锁。一朵花总是一开始是无色的。但是当你触摸它时，颜色会填满隧道。尽可能长时间地留在发光的花朵中！缓慢而轻柔地玩以获得高分。只是尽可能快地推进会导致失败。游戏希望你放轻松，玩得开心。你给一朵花带来的红晕也充满了花园。对于每朵花，寺庙里都有一根柱子。在盛开的花朵中度过的时间会使它的柱子变大。花园开始时是空白的，就像隧道一样。但经过几次旅行，它绽放出色彩。为花朵增添色彩，为花园带来欢乐和美丽！,"A simple game of touch, pleasure and joy. Luxuria Superbia is a colorful, musical journey made to fill you with joy. Exciting designs explode from your touch as you glide through playful stylized flowers. It’s all about the experience and the interaction. There’s twelve flower-like tunnels and a garden with a temple. In the garden, you select a flower by turning the dial. When you complete a flower the next one is unlocked. A flower always starts out colorless. But when you touch it, color fills the tunnel. Stay in the glowing flower as long as possible! Play slowly and gently to get a high score. Just pushing through as fast as you can will result in failure. The game wants you to take it easy and be playful. The blush you cause to a flower imbues the garden too. For each flower, there’s a column in the temple. Time spent in a blooming flower makes its column grow. The garden starts blank, just like the tunnels. But over several journeys, it flourishes with color. Bring color to the flowers, bring joy and beauty to the garden!","“Luxuria Superbia 是一款明亮、充满活力的游戏,它会让你微笑,也会让你脸红。”The Verge “这很容易是一些知识分子的色情文章,一些关于意象的崇高论文。它不是,它很有趣,很有挑战性,而且有点不修边幅。卫报 “如果 Georgia O'Keefe 和 Claude Monet 有一个电子游戏的爱子会怎样？” iHobo","“Luxuria Superbia is a bright, vibrant game that will make you smile as much as it will make you blush.” The Verge “It could easily have been some intellectual erotic essay, some lofty treatise on libidinous imagery.

An incredibly missed feature from RPG Maker XP returns with MZ! Map layer control has returned. You can now select which of the four map layers you are drawing onto, or leave it on Automatic to keep the behavior from MV. This gives you more control to make your maps look the way you want to, as well as speeding up the map creation process: No more having to redo an entire tile because you messed up one layer or want to change the base layer! ●Shadow pen rectangle mode for wide-area manipulation Holding down the Shift key when selecting a shadow pen allows you to switch to rectangle mode, which manipulates a wide area. ● Map Trees can be Rearranged You can now rearrange the Maps in the editor Map Tree even on the same tree level, making it easier than ever to organize your project for maximum efficiency. Character Generator Not only can you use the included characters or import your own made completely from scratch, you can also create your own original characters using component pieces using the built in Character Generator! Combine hairs, eyes, clothes, accessories, and more. Recolor them to match your vision. ● Adjust Component Positioning You can now use the offset feature in the Character Generator to adjust the placement of generator pieces, giving you greater control over the look of your heroes, villains, and NPCs! ● Add New Color Palettes You can now go beyond the existing color palettes: add your own palettes for recoloring hair, clothes, and more!

Here you store the information defining your characters, their skills, equipment, classes, but also their foes! Also in the database will be where you define many things about your game, like the names of stats, what conditions your characters can be afflicted with, battle animations, and more. ●Maximum number of major database entries can be changed to 9999 The maximum number of Actors,Classes, States, Skills, Items, Weapons, Armors, Enemies, Troops, and Common Events can now be set to 9999. This allows you to realize the game you want to create, such as a game with a wide variety of items. ●Copy and paste tileset settings Passage, Passage (4 dir), Ladder, Bush, Counter, Damage Floor, and Terrain Tag setting can now be copied and pasted to other tileset pages. This makes it easier to set up alternate tilesets. ● New Battle System Added! With RPG Maker MZ, in addition to the front and side-view options that existed in previous RPG Makers, we've added a brand new option! The Time Progress Battle System will unchain your game from traditional turns, allowing every character to act at their own speed based on their stats and conditions. Events The Event system covers all the many NPCs, treasure chests, puzzles and everything else your players will interact with in your game. Using a simple system of menus, you can create a complex series of events that will drive your game to its conclusion. All with no programming knowledge required! ● We have added an 'Quick Setting' feature that allows you to specify coordinates from the preview screen in the picture (image) settings. This makes setting up images simple and intuitive. ● We have added a 'Quick Access' that allows you to instantly access your favorite maps. This enables you to quickly find maps you frequently use. ● Switch to event mode to display the event list Selecting an event on the list will select the corresponding event on the map. You can also open the event editor directly from the list. ● More Powerful and Extensive Event Commands! Through the addition of elements including control characters for text displays, picture movement settings and status determination for buttons used during conditional branching, we've augmented and expanded event commands. ●Toggle Skip' to disable a specified range of event command With the execution selected, [Skip] is created by using the shortcut key Ctrl+/ or the context menu [Toggle Skip] operation. This is useful when searching for the cause of a bug or testing the direction, since the event commands contained in [Skip] to [End] are not executed. ● Preview Added for Movement Route Settings! When setting up events, now you can check movement routes using a preview. Animation ●Particle animation with enhanced 3D expression With RPG Maker MZ, our Animations function has been completely revamped.

Plugins Sometimes, you want to go beyond what is easy to do with eventing alone. That is when Plugins come in! Plugins are bits of code that can change almost anything in your RPG Maker game. Learn to code enough to make some yourself, or find ones made by others to bolster your game. Adding an existing plugin can be as easy as plugging it in! ● Revamped Plug-in Commands It's now possible to select a plug-in name and command name from a pull-down menu rather than having to enter it from text.

太空站大亨,Space Station Tycoon,现在是公元 3000 年。人类已经将影响力扩展到星际各处，创造了一个繁荣的经济，现在又寻求企业家精神来支持他们的主张。这是您建立横跨银河系的空间站帝国的机会。各种各样的飞行员在银河系中徘徊，由您来弄清楚什么会给您带来最大的成功。每个飞行员都有自己的优先事项和需求;从给他们的船加油，满足他们对酒精的渴望，到赌掉他们辛苦赚来的钱。尽管他们各自在空间站中寻找的东西非常不同，但他们有一个共同点;他们想花点钱。但是，有利润的地方总是需要考虑风险。海盗们在每个角落都在寻找分数。随着飞行员需求的变化，市场会波动并可能使您的努力破产。与此同时，有什么神秘的东西潜伏在阴影中，等待合适的时机来袭。在 Space Station Tycoon 中，您将通过建造许多不同的东西来扩展您的空间站，例如停靠区、研究设施，甚至是赌场，以吸引各种类型的客户。在明星中传播您的影响力，创建那种您会自豪地称之为自己的电台。Space Station Tycoon 的灵感来自其 “大亨 ”类型的最伟大祖先。我们从中汲取了灵感，想打造我们自己的科幻宇宙大亨游戏。玩家有机会体验经营自己的电台的需求。我们的主要目标是确保战略深度和艰难的选择是您所做的一切的首要任务。,"It’s the year 3000AD. Humanity has spread its reach across the stars, created a booming economy, and now seeks entrepreneurial spirits to stake their claims. It is your chance to build a space station empire that spans across the galaxy. All sorts of pilots wander the galaxy and it's up to you to figure out what will bring you the most success. Each pilot has their own priorities and needs; ranging from refueling their ships, satisfying their desire for alcohol, or gambling away their hard-earned cash. Even though what they each look for in a space station is very different, there is one thing they have in common; they want to spend some money. But where there’s profit, there are always risks to consider. Pirates are around every corner looking for a score. Markets will fluctuate and potentially bankrupt your efforts as the demands of pilots change. Meanwhile, something mysterious lurks in the shadow, waiting for the right time to strike. In Space Station Tycoon you will expand your station by building lots of different stuff like docking bays, research facilities, and even casinos to attract every kind of customer you can. Spread your influence among the stars and create the kind of station you would be proud to call your own. Space Station Tycoon is inspired by its greatest ancestors of the “tycoon” genre. We took those inspirations and wanted to create our own tycoon game set in a sci-fi universe. Where the player has a chance to experience the demands of running their own station. Our main goal is to ensure that strategic depth and difficult choices are at the forefront of everything you do.","“虽然 Space Station Tycoon 仍处于抢先体验阶段,但它已经非常有趣并且绝对可以玩。就像任何优秀的大亨游戏一样,你能得到的规模和坏蛋真的没有限制——即使是天空也不是极限,你就在其中！嘿,Poor Player“对于一个由非常小的独立团队制作的游戏来说,这是他们的第一款游戏,它已经是我书中的顶级作品——这是一款值得一看的游戏。游戏趋势","“Although Space Station Tycoon is still in Early Access, it’s already incredibly enjoyable and definitely playable.

You can focus on combat and offense with a heavily-armed crew, or go quietly with sensors, cloaks and shields. Use randomly generated Deadnauts, or fine-tune your crew with the character generator.

Battle alongside allies online in four-player co-op or go it alone in spectacular procedurally-generated landscapes to complete daring missions and collect powerful new weapons, armor, and arcane relics of legend. STORY Five years have passed since Lo Wang shattered the alliance between his deceitful former boss and the ancient gods of the shadow realm. Despite noble intentions, Lo Wang’s efforts to annihilate the darkness corrupted the world, creating a strange and savage new order where humans and demons live side by side. The once feared warrior now lives in the shifting wildlands outside the reach of his enemies and the neon glow of Zilla’s cybernetic metropolis, scratching out a meager existence as a hired sword for the local Yakuza clans. When a simple mission goes wrong, Lo Wang is drawn into a volatile conflict between a brilliant young scientist, his nemesis Orochi Zilla, and the demonic forces that have become unsettled in our world. The sharp-tongued hero must once again wield lethal blades, staggering firepower, and archaic magic to purge the world of evil. FEATURES Blades and Bullets: Lo Wang delivers his own brand full throttle brutality with an expanded array of over 70 lethal blades and explosive firearms to overcome the demonic opposition.

ROSE Online,ROSE Online,我们不知道 Arua 来自哪里，也不知道她是如何成为的。然而，我们确实知道，在 Arua 之前什么都不存在。生命、灵魂和所有存在的女神按照她认为合适的方式创造了宇宙......一个平静而美丽的地方，灵魂可以安居。宇宙的深层物质孕育着生命的波浪，所有生物都会在上面舒缓地摇曳。这个完美的宇宙被称为灵魂之海。生命将以七颗行星的形式为灵魂之海带来光芒。Arua 出于爱创造了这些，并将每一个都献给了她为之注入生命的居民。“行星，就像你的生命一样，亲爱的，都是你的。我也是。你们的灵魂也是。这些是 Arua 的话，当他们出生时，这些话在每个人的心中响起。“我把神赐给你，让它们看顾你。好好赞美他们，因为没有一种爱能比得上你从他们那里得到的爱。因此，众神被创造出来，守护着 Arua 在七颗行星中创造的所有生命。Arua 以照顾他们的每一位众神和女神的名字命名了这些行星：Junon、Lunar、Eldeon、Orlo、Karkia、Skaaj 和 Hebarn。每个星球的居民都过着幸福的生活，崇拜各自的上帝或女神，并陶醉于生活在他们的保护和统治下带来的乐趣。但一切都不是很和谐。黑暗之神 Hebarn 从其他星球解散，他摧毁 Arua 宇宙的阴谋开始了。很快，关于陌生访客的八卦开始了。天外来客保护生命，并从所有错误中伸出正义。他们是神圣的存在;他们很少忍受饥饿或口渴，他们不需要像大多数其他生物那样多的睡眠，但他们会受伤，他们可以爱。他们可以提供帮助。毕竟，这就是 Arua 创建它们的原因 主要特点： 自定义您的游戏玩法 您选择最适合您的游戏类型的统计数据和技能，每个职业都有多个技能树选项，让您获得属于自己的体验。玩家创造自己的传奇 ROSE Online 中的任务会受到用户社区活动的影响。你关注谁;Arua 还是 Hebarn？定制你的卡通 你不仅限于丑陋的盔甲或单一的外观，当你选择与怪物战斗或与他人进行 PvP 时，你可以把你的卡通装扮成你想要的任何东西。在 PvP 期间与机甲城堡装备战斗时，您可以看起来像一个大果冻豆，这完全取决于您。与朋友组队不仅可以让您像传统 MMO 一样受益，还可以获得更多的经验值，并且凭借有助于派对的玩家技能，乐趣也会大大增加！,"We don't know where Arua came from, nor how she came to be. We do know, however, that nothing existed before Arua. The Goddess of life, souls, and all existence created the universe as she saw fit… a calm and beautiful place where souls could dwell peacefully. The deep matters of the universe cradled the waves of life, on which all beings would sway soothingly. This perfect universe was called the Sea of Souls. Life would bring shine to the Sea of Souls, in the form of seven planets. Arua created these out of love, and dedicated each of them to the inhabitants that she breathed life into. 'The planets, as your lives, dear ones, are all yours. As am I. As are your souls.' These are the words of Arua that ring in everyone's hearts when they are born. 'To you, I give the Gods, to watch over you. Praise them well, for no love can ever match the one you will receive from them.' And thus, the Gods were created, to watch over all life that Arua had created among the seven planets. And Arua named the planets after each of the Gods and Goddesses that would look after them: Junon, Lunar, Eldeon, Orlo, Karkia, Skaaj, and Hebarn. Each planet's inhabitants lived in happiness, idolizing their respective God or Goddess, and reveling in the pleasures that living under their protection and rule brought. But all was not harmonious for long. The Dark God Hebarn disbanded from the other planets, and his plots to destroy Arua's universe began. Soon, the gossips about strange visitors started. The Visitors protect life, and make right from all that is wrong. They are divine beings; they seldom suffer from hunger or thirst, they do not need as much sleep as most other creatures, but they can hurt, they can love. And they can help. That is why Arua created them, after all Key Features: Customize Your Game Play You pick your stats and skills that best fit your type of game play with multiple skill tree options for each class that allows for an experience that is your own. Players Make their Own Legend The quests in ROSE Online are affected by the activities of the user community. Who do you follow; Arua or Hebarn? Customize Your Toon You are not confined to ugly armors or a single look, you can outfit your toon to be just about anything you want to look like while you pick fights with monsters or engage others in PvP. You can look like a large Jelly Bean while fighting a Mech Castle Gear during PvP it is all up to you. Party Play Grouping with your friends doesn't just allow you to benefit like a traditional MMO, but you earn vastly more EXP and with player skills that help with the Party the enjoyment is vastly increased as well!","“Rose Online 拥有出色的图形和丰富的内容,可以让玩家保持兴趣。快速的练级和简单的游戏玩法为 Rose 提供了良好的节奏“ – MMOHut ”这个世界上弥漫着一种可爱,感觉是一种快乐。您可能会在游戏中浪费数小时,尤其是在初次涉足世界时。“ – GameZone","“Rose Online has great graphics and plenty of content to keep players interested.

传奇重装步兵,Legendary Hoplite,《Ithaca: The War of Gods》是一款结合ARPG战斗与塔防策略的神话题材动作游戏。你将扮演年轻指挥官 Dio，肩负保卫故乡伊萨卡的重任，率军抵御来自希腊神话中的怪物大军，包括九头蛇、弥诺陶洛斯、地狱三头犬等传说Boss。,"Play as Dio, a young commander inspired by the old heroes from Greek mythos like Achilles, Hector, and Perseus. He uses spears, swords and shields to slay thousands of monsters attacking the city of Ithaca. Dio has yet to discover his true power with a wide selection of gear to be used, godlike powers to be summoned and entire new armies to be drafted for battle. This is a war for the fate of mankind. The monsters that will try to breach your defense are many and varied. You'll need to think carefully about combat tactics and power balance, especially when dealing with legendary bosses. The most important goal is to not let the enemy pass through the gate. Fight against the beasts and legendary tribes from Greek mythology. They will use all their might to break through your ranks and shatter the line of defense. In battles, you must lead your army and think of the right strategies to face different enemies. The mundane weapons of the world are not enough to repel the attacks of the mighty monsters. Dio needs the weapons with deadly power, the artifacts blessed by the Gods themselves. Besides strategically arranging the armies, you'll need to upgrade them through battles to match the stronger and more unusual enemies. The classic skill tree upgrade system combined with the sets of war technique provide the required versatility. Changing them will open up tactical options and let your defenders vanquish the ever-changing monster waves. Make your own build with a combination of skills and become a powerful adversary for your enemies. Your enemies are the beasts and legendary races from Greek mythology who conflicted with humans since the dawn of time and have long wanted to exterminate them. The legions of the dead started this war, gathered the army and attacked Ithaca in great numbers. The beasts and monsters from around the region took advantage of the opportunity to advance their forces. Pay special attention to the bosses. They are creatures of legend that caused much suffering to mankind. Now, they will use their impetuous primordial strength to break through our defenses. Stop them from destroying our homeland and killing our people at any cost. The Trojan War is over. Odysseus, king of Ithaca, became a legend because of his trick with the Trojan horse. Having returned from Troy, Odysseus regained the throne of Ithaca, but peace did not last long... An unexpected event led to Odysseus’s death at the hand of his illegitimate son. This incident revealed a critical secret and brought an endless horde of monsters to the gates of Ithaca. Over 40 levels where ARPG meets Tower Defense. Over 150 types of monsters with hundreds of variants. Many bosses from the original Greek mythology, including Cerberus, Hydra, Gorgon, Minotaur, etc. Plenty of items to collect and equip in your endless hunt. Various armies with dozens of special skills that enable countless strategies. And many more secrets tied to the achievement system waiting to be discovered.","“Legendary Hoplite 似乎以一种简单但令人满意的方式翻译了它的主题,直接从希腊神话和电影改编中提炼了意象和生物。事实上,游戏玩法的重点是保卫位于咽喉要道的大门,所以它也确实让人想起了 300 个。TryHardGuides,Anthony Fertino “到目前为止,我所看到的一切都指向一个引人入胜的游戏循环,即与越来越强大的对手作战,获得更多能力来帮助防御他们,并从每场战斗中获得强大的战利品。”独立告密者,吉尔·格罗特 “这是一款有趣的游戏,其中单位的战略布局是关键,尤其是在面对强大的 Boss 时,例如地狱犬、牛头怪和九头蛇” AlphaBetaGamer,KJ 罗伯逊","“Legends of Pixelia plays like a beat ‘em up dressed in rogue-like dungeons. […] The systems that are in place are really solid, and the gameplay ideas come through in the form of a fun, multiplayer beat em’ up in a dungeons-and-dragons-like vibe.” Indie Game Magazine “Legends of Pixelia is an excellent pixel art action RPG with gameplay reminiscent of The Binding of Isaac, but with more tactical combat, persistent upgrades and local multiplayer.” Alpha Beta Gamer “Legends of Pixelia is familiar enough to be approachable to fans of the genre while still offering up something new. Fans of skill-based combat in games will want to give this a look, and for folks who like action RPGs I think there’s enough progression to keep you compelled for a little while.”"

Warfare between the Russian Empire, Germany, and their allies offers a fresh experience for first person shooter players and history enthusiasts alike. There are seven squads, 50+ weapons, eight large maps that give players tactical freedom, and a 64 player game mode with full AI bot support so you can experience epic battles at any time! Everything has been recreated with the same attention to detail seen in Verdun, the first entry in the WW1 Game Series. This historical game takes place across the lakes, forests, mountains and snowy plains of the Eastern Front - it was inspired by the Battle of Tannenberg in 1914, one of the most iconic encirclement battles in history. Players will be able to master a range of authentically modelled equipment brought to the field by Russian Frontovik and Cossack squads, the renowned Latvian Riflemen, or the Roumanian infantry squad. Alternatively they can join the Central Powers to serve in an Austro-Hungarian K.u.K. unit, with the German Infanterie, or in the Bulgarian rifle section. Tannenberg offers several game modes - including the exciting Maneuver game mode reflecting the nature of war on the Eastern Front, as 64 players battle across large maps where the objectives and battle lines are always shifting. Survive the deadly battles by working together with your four man squad and utilizing your distinctive skills. There is a wealth of historical detail including realistic WW1 weaponry, authentic uniforms, horrendous gore, and maps based on real battlefields. Tannenberg key features include: Authentic WW1 atmosphere; accuracy in everything from maps and weaponry to uniforms Tactical squad-based FPS; play as Russian, Roumanian, Latvian, Austro-Hungarian, German and Bulgarian troops Wide-ranging landscapes; large maps each with weather variants from snow to summer sun 64 player Maneuver game mode; capture strategic sectors in grand battles of movement Never fight alone; squad gameplay and AI bots for Maneuver so you can join epic battles at any time WW1 on the Eastern Front It’s all-out war on the Eastern Front! From artillery barrages and poison gas to the deadly heavy machine gun and hard-hitting rifle, there are many weapons to master. The battlefield is a dangerous place – lead your shots, keep your eyes open, and be ready to engage in ferocious close combat at any moment. Tannenberg’s Maneuver game mode captures the essence of warfare on the Eastern Front, with 64 players, large open maps, and the freedom to choose which sectors you will attack and defend. Just make sure you don’t get outflanked and encircled before you can do the same to your enemies! Authentic World War 1 Setting The WW1 Game Series currently includes Tannenberg, Verdun set on the Western Front, and Isonzo, which is set on the Italian Front. These authentic WW1 shooters let players choose from a range of squads from across the war, as they fight for control of the ever-changing frontlines. We recreate the atmosphere of the Eastern Front with the same level of accuracy as seen in Verdun. Extensive research has been conducted, with uniforms recreated to the tiniest detail and weapons modelled to exact references. The maps use realistic props and terrain layouts based on locations from the hilly forests of Galicia to Polish villages subjected to scorched earth tactics and more!","“对细节的关注和对真实性的痴迷,即使不是完全准确,在坦能堡可能比在凡尔登更重要。”Fraser Brown （Rock Paper Shotgun） “独立开发团队煞费苦心地重现了第一次世界大战东部战线的冲突。战斗人员、武器动画和音效的细节营造出身临其境的体验。8.5 – Laura Thurston （GameWatcher） “Tannenberg 和开发团队所做的工作真正让我印象深刻的是他们对细节的关注'......“我认为这是团队的功劳,他们制作了一些实际上非常非常吸引人的东西。”韦斯特","“An eye for detail and an obsession with authenticity, if not complete accuracy, is possibly even more important in Tannenberg than it was in Verdun.” Fraser Brown (Rock Paper Shotgun) “The indie development team have painstakingly recreated the conflict of WWI’s eastern front.

末日帝国,Armageddon Empires,"注意：这款游戏最初于 2007 年发布，屏幕分辨率固定为 1024×768，最佳窗口模式运行。游戏安装文件夹中包含全屏可执行文件，会拉伸以适应宽屏显示器，包括《废土邪教》和《矛头》扩展包。《末日帝国》是一款电脑回合制策略游戏，它融合了集换式卡牌游戏（不用担心，无需追逐卡牌，你会获得所有卡牌）、棋盘游戏和电脑游戏的最佳元素，带来独特的互动策略战争游戏体验。你可以选择普通大小的地图，与单个 AI 对手进行死亡竞赛，在一小时内结束，或者选择巨大地图，与其他 3 个派系进行史诗般的激烈战斗。玩家首先选择四个派系之一并构建自己的牌组，每个派系都有独特的玩法风格、优势和劣势。有 7 种主要卡牌类型：英雄、单位、设施、攻击（飞机、直升机 / 悬浮机和导弹）、附件、弹药、战术。游戏地图每次游玩时随机生成，并分布有资源和独立单位与设施。玩家通过消耗资源储备来出牌，在这个严酷的新世界中，建造帝国需要 4 种基本资源：人力、材料、能源和技术，它们都分布在游戏棋盘上，有些集中在人类城市的废墟中，有些在被遗忘的战场的垃圾堆中，或简单地埋在广阔的废土中。游戏开始后，你会想部署英雄和单位并探索地图，一些六边形格子会包含资源，一些会隐藏独立单位，这些单位和设施从人类奴隶贩子、袭击者和雇佣兵到外星军阀、 rogue 机器智囊和变异怪物不等。根据你的派系，有些会主动提出加入你的事业（可能需要代价），而有些则会与你战斗至死。侦察完地图、定位敌人并组建军队后，你会想发动战争。一切都需要行动点，所以要好好计划你的行动，或许你想先用一些空中力量削弱敌人。从手牌中打出攻击卡牌，可对位于你的要塞和前哨范围内的敌军发动攻击，拖动飞机、导弹或直升机（悬浮船）卡牌并将其放置在敌人编队上，战斗即开始。你的卡牌攻击强度由水平滚动区域的骰子表示，目标的防御强度由下方滚动区域的骰子表示，每个骰子有 3 面带有派系符号表示成功，3 面空白表示失败。双方掷骰子，计算成功次数，然后尝试修改结果，一些飞机以及所有英雄都有命运点，可用于重掷任何失败的空对地骰子，战术卡牌可大幅改变结果 —— 为你的骰子池添加正面骰子、重掷对手骰子、将其转为失败甚至移除。如果攻击者掷出的点数高于防御者，则差值作为伤害应用。军队在棋盘上由矩形棋子表示，每支军队可包含 1 名英雄和最多 8 个单位（卡牌），但必须注意不要超过英雄的指挥评级，否则其攻击、防御和移动将受到影响。当两个非隐形军队在一个六边形格子相遇时，战斗开始，这些战斗可包含多支军队，因此首先让你确定战斗顺序。战斗是军队对军队，直到一方被摧毁、溃败（仅剩下领袖）或被其所有者撤退。在战场上留下有战斗能力军队的玩家是胜利者，并获得该六边形格子的控制权。任何幸存的被击败单位若选择撤退，将遭受撤退攻击，其英雄可能在溃败中被俘或被杀。俘虏敌方英雄特别有利，因为他们会被关押在最近的友方要塞或前哨，每回合为玩家生成 1 点额外行动点。地面战斗是残酷的事情，就像空中攻击一样，你的卡牌攻击强度由水平滚动区域的骰子表示，目标的防御强度由下方滚动区域的骰子表示，双方掷骰子，计算成功次数，然后尝试修改结果。如果攻击掷骰大于防御掷骰，则差值作为伤害施加给防御者。一旦一个单位攻击或执行特殊能力，它就会被标记为已行动，直到下一回合才能采取进一步行动。玩家轮流攻击或使用能力，直到回合结束，然后双方都有机会评估情况，可以选择撤回当前活跃的地面战斗军队（每个单位都会受到一次免费攻击）、撤退所有军队（同样会受到免费攻击，并且会尝试俘虏 / 杀死任何军队中没有单位的英雄）或继续战斗。如果双方都选择撤退，则不会受到免费攻击。要在废土的斗争中获胜，你必须占领或摧毁每个敌人的要塞，这听起来很简单，但有许多路径可以实现这一目标。你可以发动残酷直接的地面战役，在实验室开发秘密武器并汽化敌人，或使用隐形和破坏来消灭敌人，选择权在你手中，但请记住，你的敌人也会对你采取行动，一颗好的核弹就足以毁了你的一天。

The screen resolution is fixed at 1024 by 768 and best played in a windowed mode. A full screen executable is included in the game's installation folder; it will stretch to fit wide screen monitors. Incudes: Cults of the Wasteland and Tip of the Spear expansions. Armageddon Empires is a computer turn based strategy game that takes the best elements of collectable card games (don’t worry there are no cards to chase you get them all), board games, and computer games and brings them all together to provide a unique interactive strategy war game experience. You can choose a normal size map and battle in a death match with a single AI opponent finishing within an hour or select a huge map and slug it out with the other 3 factions in a game of epic proportions. Players start by choosing one of four factions and building their playing decks. Each faction has its own play-style, strengths and weaknesses. There are 7 main card types: Heroes, Units, Facilities, Attack (Aircraft, Helo/Hover and Missile), Attachments, Munitions, Tactics. The game map is created randomly each time you play and seeded with resources and independent units and facilities. Your cards are played by drawing on your resource stockpiles. 4 basic resources are necessary to build your empire in the harsh new world. Humans, Materials, Energy and Technology are all strewn across the playing board. Some are concentrated in the ruins of human cities; others are found in the junk heaps of forgotten battlefields or simply lying buried in the vast wastes. Once the game is underway, you will want to deploy your heroes and units and explore the map. Some hexes will contain resources; some will harbor independents. These units and facilities range from human slavers, raiders and mercenaries to alien warlords, rogue machine masterminds and mutated monsters. Depending on your faction some will offer to join your cause (maybe for a price) while others will fight you to the death. With the map scouted out, your enemies located and your armies formed up, you will want to unleash the dogs of war. Everything costs Action Points, so plan your moves well. You might want to use some air power to soften up the enemy first. Attack cards are played from your hand and can strike enemy armies within range of your stronghold and outposts. Drag the Aircraft, Missile or Helo (Hover Ship) card and drop it on an enemy formation and the battle is joined. Your card’s attack strength is represented by die on the horizontal rolling area. The target’s defense strength is represented below yours by the die on the lower rolling area. Each die has 3 sides with the faction’s symbol denoting a success and 3 sides that are blank denoting failure. Both players roll their dice, count up their successes and then try and modify the results. Some aircraft as well as all heroes have fate points they can spend to re-roll Air to groundany die that failed. Tactic cards can be played to drastically change the results…add positive die to your pool, re-roll opponent’s die, turn them to failures, or even remove them. If the attacker rolls higher than the defender then the difference is applied as damage. Armies are represented by rectangular playing pieces on the board. Each army can contain 1 hero and up to 8 units (cards) but you will have to be careful not to exceed your hero’s command rating or their attack, defense and movement will suffer. When two non-stealthed armies meet in a hex a battle ensues. These battles can encompass multiple stacks of armies so you are first given the chance to determine the order in which they will fight. Battles are army versus army until one side is destroyed, gutted (only a leader remains) or retreated by their owner. The player remaining on the battle field with a combat capable army is the winner and gains control of the hex. Any surviving defeated units are subjected to a retreat attack if they opted to retreat and their heroes may be captured or killed in the rout. Capturing enemy heroes is particularly advantageous as they are interred in the nearest friendly stronghold or outpost and generate 1 bonus Action Point per player turn. Ground Combat is a brutal affair. Just like air attacks, your card’s attack strength is represented by die on the horizontal rolling area. The target’s defense strength is represented below yours by the die on the lower rolling area. Both players roll their die, count the successes and then try and modify the results. If the attack roll is greater than the defense roll then the difference is applied as damage to the defender. Once a unit attacks or performs a special ability it is marked as committed and may not take any further actions until the next round. Players take turns attacking or playing abilities until the end of the round is reached. Both players then have the chance to assess the situation and either withdraw the currently active armyground combat (each unit is subjected to a free attack), retreat all armies (again a free attack is taken as well as a capture/kill attempt for any heroes without units in their army) or continue the fight. If both sides elect to retreat than no free attacks are taken. To win the struggle for the wasteland you must occupy or destroy each of your enemies’ strongholds. It sounds simple enough but there are many paths to achieve that objective. You can wage a brutal straight forward ground campaign, develop a secret weapon in your laboratories and vaporize your enemy, or use stealth and sabotage to eliminate your enemy. The choice is up to you but keep in mind your enemies will be moving against you as well. All it takes is one good nuke to ruin your day.","“归根结底,所有其他考虑因素都是次要的。这是一个关于有意义决定的游戏。第一个也是最有意义的决定,当然是玩演示并购买的东西。8/10 – EUROGAMER “Cryptic Comet 出色地捕捉了世界末日帝国的桌面战争游戏。”8.5/10 – 游戏幕府将军 “Cryptic Comet's Armageddon Empires 是一款电脑屏幕上的棋盘游戏。”7.5/10 – 游戏 Nexus","“All other considerations, ultimately, are secondary.

Darknet is reminiscent of Hollywood's appalling movie interpretation of 'hacking' from the '90s, but it's fun and engaging.” - CNET “Completely worth your time. An interesting puzzle game where you have to hack into different computer system using an array of tools, it also winkingly makes fun of the 90s-era version of VR. If you ever wanted to pretend you were a hacker from the 1995 film Hackers, this is a pretty good place to start.” - Polygon 'And therein lies the beauty of Darknet. The game is simple on its surface, yet it's filled with challenges that keep you pressing on to beat the next one. I thought I was going to play Darknet for 20 minutes or so to get a feel for the game.

日落余晖,Sunset,1972年 ，一场军事政变震撼了拉丁美洲的一个小国安楚里亚。因此，你，安吉拉·伯恩斯，美国公民，被困在圣巴冯的都市首都。你的天堂变成了一个战场。为了维持生计，你找了一份清洁工的工作。每周，日落前一小时，你都会打扫富有的加布里埃尔·奥尔特加的豪华单身公寓。你被分配了一系列任务，但翻看他的东西的诱惑是无法抗拒的。他在搞什么？随着你对神秘的缺席雇主的了解加深，你被卷入了一个反抗该国以铁腕统治的臭名昭著的独裁者的叛乱阴谋。“落日”使用劳动的日常性作为讲述阶级和政治革命故事的框架——Simon Parkin，《Eurogamer》“落日”作为一款思考性的、沉思的步行模拟游戏，探索了这个媒介中不常涉及的社会主题和斗争——GameSpot，Josiah Renaudin“落日”是一部美妙的氛围缓慢燃烧的电影，为一个以“给你一把大枪，邀请你深入其中”为主要冲突方式的媒介增添了价值——Philippa Warr，《Rock Paper Shotgun》“故事出色，会吸引你，让你感觉自己就是安吉拉·伯恩斯。”——Jessica Mock，《Hardcore Gamer》“与其关注军事政变的明显暴力，落日关注战争的情感残酷。”——Reid McCarter，《Playboy》《落日》是一款叙事驱动的第一人称探索游戏，专注于发现你游玩过程中发生的故事的线索。《落日》部分灵感来源于战争背景的动作游戏，就像许多第一人称射击游戏一样。在这样的游戏中，NPC的生活会是什么样子？当战争成为你日常生活的背景时，感觉如何？《落日》分为44个游戏环节，每个环节都持续虚构的一小时：直到日落。每次你都会收到一份需要完成的任务清单。但在公寓里还有其他活动，比如翻看主人的物品以获取信息，以及与他20世纪70年代的科技小玩意互动。安吉拉·伯恩斯并不是一个空洞的容器。她有自己的个性，你在游玩过程中会发现她的想法。作为一名60年代末的美国公民，她受到黑人力量和民权运动的启发。为了更多地了解平等，她前往当时的社会主义共和国安楚里亚。在她的访问期间，发生了一场美国支持的军事政变，她被禁止离开这个国家。她的大学学位没有被新政权认可，她被迫做清洁工以维持生计。安吉拉的弟弟大卫，也跟着她来到了安楚里亚，最终加入了地下抵抗运动。当战争真正开始时，安吉拉必须担心他的安危。加布里埃尔·奥尔特加是一位艺术爱好者。通过他作为策展人的工作，他认识了富有的维莱塔家族的玛丽亚·路易莎。多亏了他们家族的钱，加布里埃尔成为了一位备受赞誉的艺术赞助人。政变发生后，剧院和博物馆被关闭。新政府向富有的公民提供安全和权力职位。加布里埃尔的妻子，以及她家族和他们的大多数朋友，都乐意接受，但加布里埃尔拒绝了。这对夫妇之间的紧张关系最终导致了分离。《落日》的故事开始于加布里埃尔·奥尔特加搬进圣巴冯首都的一套新顶层公寓。正是在这套公寓里，安吉拉·伯恩斯找到了工作。第一人称探索，带有熟悉的控制（WASD + 鼠标查看），或者根据你的喜好进行自定义氛围：酷炫的1972年风格，反射，日落余晖，战争的静谧与紧张，时间的流逝影响两位主角之间的关系，情感叙事弧线随着你的游玩而展开悬念十足的故事驱动游戏玩法：互动以探索虚构环境响应环境（灯光开关、唱片播放器、电子小玩意等）没有失败状态——这不是一个你能赢或输的游戏，只能影响游戏时间从90分钟到22小时不等，取决于你的游玩方式由获奖作曲家奥斯汀·温托里（《旅途》、《旗帜传说》、《摩纳哥》）创作的配乐复古20世纪70年代早期风格爆炸！Auriea Harvey和Micha?l Samyn致力于探索电子游戏作为一种艺术表现媒介。他们是《无尽森林》、《小径》、《墓地》、《命运》、《不朽》、《凡人之夏》、《虚荣》和IGF Nuovo奖得主《奢华的放纵》的创作者。在《落日》中，他们将十年的经验应用于一个更易于接触的标题，目的是与更广泛的受众分享电子游戏的美丽。奥斯汀·温托里为《落日》创作了音乐。这位格莱美和英国电影和电视艺术学院奖得主是电子游戏配乐的主要作曲家之一。他的作品包括《流动》、《旅途》、《摩纳哥》和《Gorogoa》的音乐。蒂娜·玛丽·默里为安吉拉配音。劳拉·雷恩斯·史密斯为游戏中的主角（以及迄今为止Tale of Tales所有游戏中的偶尔直升机）进行了动画制作。克里斯·福斯是一位声音设计师，你可以在《墓地》、《小径》、《命运》和《不朽》中听到他的作品。特丽莎·施拉格和尼古拉斯·罗特将再次与塞巴斯蒂安·科恩一起为《落日》建模建筑。约瑟夫·西尔弗曼和亚历克斯·穆顿帮助我们进行编程。利·亚历山大和斯蒂·卡伦，Agency提供了项目指导建议。文本是由匿名作者亲爱的塞·奥尔·X合作撰写的。《落日》是用Unity为PC、Mac和Linux创建的。制作得到了佛兰德视听基金和一群Kickstarter支持者的支持。在Facebook上关注我们：在Twitter上关注我们：观看预告片：-game.com访问游戏网站：-of-Tales.com/Sunset访问开发者网站：-of-Tales.com来安楚里亚：阅读开发日志：阅读《落日》的制作过程：-of-tales。,"It's 1972 and a military coup has rocked Anchuria, a small country in Latin America. As a result, you, Angela Burnes, US citizen, are trapped in the metropolitan capital of San Bavón. Your paradise has turned into a warzone. To make ends meet, you take up a job as a housekeeper. Every week, an hour before sunset, you clean the swanky bachelor pad of the wealthy Gabriel Ortega. You are given a number of tasks to do, but the temptation to go through his stuff is irresistible. And what is he up to? As you get to know your mysterious absent employer better, you are sucked into a rebellious plot against the notorious dictator who rules the country with an iron fist. “Sunset uses the routine of labour to exquisite effect as a framework to tell a story about class and political revolution.” – Simon Parkin, Eurogamer “Sunset acts as a thoughtful, pensive walk through social themes and struggles not often explored in this medium.” – Game Spot, Josiah Renaudin “Sunset is a wonderfully atmospheric slow burner and a valuable addition to a medium where the predominant approach to conflict is to just give you a big old gun and invite you to get stuck in.” – Philippa Warr, Rock Paper Shotgun “The story is excellent and will draw you in, making you feel as if you truly are Angela Burnes.” – Jessica Mock, Hardcore Gamer “Rather than focus on the explicit violence of a military coup, Sunset centers on the emotional brutality of war.” – Reid McCarter, Playboy Sunset is a narrative-driven first-person exploration game that centers on the discovery of clues to a story that takes place as you play. Sunset is in part inspired by action games set in a war-like context, like many first-person shooters. What life would be like for the NPCs in such games? How does it feel when war is the backdrop for your day-to-day life? Sunset is divided into 44 play sessions that each take a fictional hour: until the sun sets. Each time you get a list of tasks that you are requested to do. But there is more to do in the apartment than just work. There are other activities, such as going through the owner's possessions in search of information, and interacting with his 1970s-era technological gadgets. Angela Burnes, is not an empty vessel. She has a personality of her own and you discover her thoughts while playing. As a US citizen at the end of the sixties, she is inspired by the Black Power and civil rights movements. In an effort to learn more about egality, she travels to the then socialist republic of Anchuria. During her visit, a US-backed military coup happens and she is disallowed from leaving the country. Her university degree is not recognized by the new regime and she is forced to work as a housekeeper to sustain herself. Angela's younger brother, David, who had followed her to Anchuria ends up joining an underground resistance movement. And Angela must worry about what happens to him when the war begins in earnest. Gabriel Ortega is a lover of the arts. Through his work as a curator he met Maria Luisa of the wealthy Veleta family. Thanks to the money from their families, Gabriel became a much celebrated benefactor of the arts. When the coup happened, theaters and museums were closed. The new government offered affluent citizens safety and positions of power. Gabriel's wife, and most of her family and their friends, were happy to accept but Gabriel refused. Rising tensions between the couple ultimately lead to a separation. The story of Sunset begins when Gabriel Ortega moves into a new penthouse apartment in the capital city of San Bavón. It is in this apartment that Angela Burnes finds employment. first-person exploration with familiar controls (WASD + mouselook), or customize for your comfort atmospheric: cool 1972 style, reflections, sunset glow, stillness, tension of war, time passing influence the relationship between the two protagonists, emotional narrative arc happens as you play suspenseful story-driven gameplay: interact to explore the fiction responsive environment (light switches, record players, electronic gadgets, etc.) no fail state – this isn’t a game you can win or lose, only influence anywhere from 90 minutes to 22 hours of gameplay, depending on your approach soundtrack by the award-winning Austin Wintory (Journey, The Banner Saga, Monaco) retro early 1970s style explosions!

The royals entrusted you to settle and govern a new land, and it is your duty to exploit its riches for the benefit of the realm, your own wealth, and if you feel generous, the villagers alike! In order to do this, you will zone out plots, build houses, determine taxation policies, set priorities, and grow the supply chain alongside your population. Families are the centrepiece of Lords and Villeins. Their profession dictates their occupation in the economy and the kind of businesses they can run. Once you assign them a plot of land and build their house, they will do so almost completely autonomously, all the while managing their stock, setting aside produce to pay taxes, and trading with other families and caravans for supplies and to maximise their profit. Your role is to direct and regulate the economy. Balance the supply and demand, secure critical resources, and maintain stable growth. Lords and Villeins offers you a sandbox with an in-depth simulation and a great variety of strategies to manage it! Ranging from a fully communist economy where all produce is taxed and redistributed from your warehouse to a free marketplace with little to no intervention. Logistics will challenge your management skills. As your settlement grows, you need to keep in mind the travelling distances, storage placements, private markets, and housing while reflecting on the terrain and its natural resources in order to fully optimise the productivity of each villager. Highly customizable gameplay lets you craft the exact kind of game that fits your taste! Between a great variety of game modules and difficulty sliders, you can tweak the experience and focus on the elements of the game that you enjoy the most. While Lords and Villeins is primarily an economically driven game and military conflict plays only a small role, there are tons of options to explore and play with! Unique family-management mechanic where you assign plots of land to autonomous families and manage taxation policies, production priorities and logistics In-depth simulation of personal ownership and a market economy. Villagers manage storefronts to sell surplus goods and purchase food and material from others in a cooperative production chain. Prices of goods fluctuate based on supply and demand, and trading caravans facilitate import and export. Fully simulated procedurally generated environment with a complex AI that can develop relationships, satisfy their needs, daily routines and personal ambitions. Highly customizable difficulty settings, it is completely up to you how complex or laid-back your playthrough will be! Campaign mode with 15 distinct levels that introduce game mechanics and teach players about the game. Noble houses that visit your settlement, request resources and send gifts as you engage in diplomatic relations. Ability to build a sprawling monastery with monks, churches and chapels that host the Sunday Mass, produce unique resources and treat villagers in an outburst of a sickness. Villagers can be recruited as your personal servants or guards that protect villagers from crime. Character designer lets you fully customise and name everyone in your ruling family. 160+ objects at your disposal to build, decorate and improve your settlement. 53 different zones and 40 professions that can be performed by the villagers. 130+ resources to be used in a fully functional production chain. A number of domesticated animals and pets and thriving nature with wildlife. Visually distinct seasons with a soundtrack of seasonal themes. Fully simulated and dynamic world with changing temperature and weather effects. Lords and Villeins is inspired by medieval history, in its themes and the production processes of goods and material. However, it should not be viewed as a historically accurate simulation of medieval society and its economy as it is straying away from it in many aspects to give players more variety and serve a fun and interesting gameplay.",“你永远不会在领主和维林无事可做。”CGMag Online “Cute Colony Sim Perfect for a Reigny Day” 独立游戏迷,"“You never know what new oddities will await you on your magical mystery tour, but they always make you smile.

GROSS,GROSS,准备好在 GROSS 中享受惊心动魄的创新游戏体验，GROSS 是塔防和第一人称射击游戏的混合体。凭借其新鲜而独特的机制，当您制定战略并捍卫通往胜利的道路时，您从一开始就被吸引住。在 GROSS 中，您的任务是以经典的塔防方式保卫您的基地免受一波又一波的敌方攻击者的攻击。您可以自由建造路障和炮塔来创建迷宫并向敌人发起攻击，也可以在地面上放置陷阱以增加防御。在建造阶段，您可以尝试不同的炮塔和障碍物组合，为您的攻击者提供最有效的障碍课程。不用担心时间限制或资源浪费 - 您可以出售您构建的所有东西以获得全额退款，直到下一个战斗阶段开始。因此，如果您喜欢构建终极塔防设置的策略和满足感，那么 GROSS 就是您的不二之选！完成防御后，准备好迎接激烈、快节奏的战斗吧！触手可及的大量枪支，每支枪支都有不同的弹药类型，您必须在瞬间做出决定才能击倒一波又一波的僵尸。全金属外壳子弹可以穿透多个敌人甚至物体，而空心点可以将敌人击飞并给您一些喘息空间。燃烧弹会点燃僵尸并让它们继续燃烧，手榴弹和火箭发射器可以对成群的敌人造成巨大伤害 - 但要小心，它们也可能会摧毁有价值的现金拾取物。除了所有这些枪支，你还可以使用一系列的主动技能，让你有更多的方式来击败或分散敌人的注意力，更高效地四处移动，或者管理你的资源。有十几种武器可供选择，我们游戏中的枪战总是令人兴奋和有益的。你准备好与亡灵作战了吗？金钱是成功的关键。您需要尽快从被击败的敌人那里收集它，但要小心 - 您不是唯一一个追求这种宝贵资源的人。你需要把它带到安全的地方，这样你才能购买防御结构和主动技能，它在决定你的分数方面也起着重要作用。GROSS 让您时刻保持警觉。您采取或不采取的每一项行动都会产生后果。如果你在防御不堪重负时专注于消灭攻击者，你可能会扭转战局，但你也会冒着失去宝贵金钱的风险，这些钱可以用来在下一个建设阶段提高你的防御。保持敏锐并保持领先，脱颖而出！,"Get ready for a thrilling and innovative gaming experience with GROSS, a hybrid of tower defense and first person shooter genres. With its fresh and unique mechanics, you'll be hooked from the start as you strategize and defend your way to victory. In GROSS, you are tasked with defending your base against waves of enemy attackers in classic tower defense fashion. You have the freedom to build barricades and turrets to create mazes and launch attacks on the enemy, as well as place traps on the ground for added defense. During the construction phase, you can experiment with different combinations of turrets and barriers to come up with the most effective obstacle course for your attackers. And don't worry about time limits or wasted resources - you can sell everything you build for a full refund until the next combat phase begins. So if you love the strategy and satisfaction of building the ultimate tower defense setup, GROSS is the game for you! Once you are done building your defenses, get ready for intense, fast-paced combat! With a huge arsenal of guns at your fingertips, each featuring different ammo types, you'll have to make split-second decisions to take down waves of zombies. Full metal jacket rounds can pierce through multiple enemies and even objects, while hollow points send foes flying and give you some breathing room. Incendiary rounds ignite zombies and keep them burning, and grenade and rocket launchers can deal massive damage to groups of enemies - but watch out, they may also destroy valuable cash pickups. In addition to all these guns, you'll also have access to a range of active abilities that give you even more ways to defeat or distract enemies, move around more efficiently, or manage your resources. With over a dozen weapons to choose from, gunplay in our game is always exciting and rewarding. Are you ready to take on the undead? Money is essential for success. You'll need to gather it from defeated enemies as quickly as possible, but beware - you're not the only one after this valuable resource. You'll need to get it to safety so you can buy defensive structures and active abilities, and it also plays a major role in determining your score. GROSS keeps you on your toes at all times. Every action you take - or don't take - has consequences. If you focus on taking out attackers while your defenses are overwhelmed, you might turn the tide of battle, but you'll also risk losing precious money that could be used to improve your defenses in the next construction phase.

Features: Challenging puzzles. 50 official levels that range from cakewalk to what-the-hell-this-is-impossible-right-tell-me-this-is-impossible. But guess what, it IS possible. I think. Infinite solutions. Working cars, tanks, catapults, conveyor belts, walking creatures or minimalist structures that use only gravity. Design for elegant simplicity, or build a rattling pile of junk that just barely makes it to the goal. Whatever. Building with your own hands. Movement so simple and natural you'll forget you're holding controllers. Need a wheel? Just pick it up. Want a longer rod? Just grab an end and stretch. It's like playing with children's blocks, except they're bigger than you are. Noble ancestry. Fantastic Contraption is the VR evolution of Colin Northway's 2008 2d browser game, played by millions and still playable for free . But don't be fooled, this new game is WAY different. Full 3d audio and music. Actually, this game has no music. What it does have is musical instruments. Except you have to build them. Well... you'll figure it out. Surreal and beautiful landscape. Hey guy, chill here awhile, why don't you just lie down in the grass and just listen to the sky whales singing? You'll totally forget the dystopian present and the 300 sqft windowless cube you now live in. Who needs sunlight? VR. Neko the toolbox. Yes, your toolbox is alive, and he's kind of a green cat blimp thing powered by pink farts. He doesn't seem to mind when you pull off one of his tails or yank a pin out of his head. They grow back pretty fast, so I guess it's okay... Online sharing. Venture bravely into the dark world-within-a-world to load contraptions made by your friends and also some random people. Marvel at the crazy crap they came up with. Then narrow your eyes and say: I can beat this. I can do better. Level Editor. Make your own puzzles to share with your friends and the community.","“令人印象深刻的直觉和异想天开。”Kotaku “Fantastic Contraption 是一款出色的益智游戏,让您在耳机关闭后很长一段时间内都会考虑构建新机器。”UploadVR “如果 Fantastic Contraption 以某种方式存在于现实世界中,它会按照您期望的方式工作,结果是一款奖励创造力的富有想象力的游戏。我迫不及待地想玩更多。多边形","“Impressively intuitive and whimsical as f**k.” Kotaku “Fantastic Contraption is a great puzzle game that keeps you thinking about building new machines long after the headset is off.” UploadVR “Fantastic Contraption works the way you'd expect it to if it somehow existed in the real world, and the result is an imaginative game that rewards creativity.

锈桶大乱斗,Rustbucket Rumble,《铁桶大乱斗》是一款横版、团队制、竞技场战斗游戏。玩家从6种性格、能力和武器各不相同的机器人角色中选择，组成两个3人的队伍。玩家必须与队友合作，攻击敌方机器人，直到它们被变成废铁，然后将废铁运回基地作为回收材料。这是一场“夺旗”游戏，只不过玩家就是旗帜！当一个队伍收集到足够的废铁后，他们可以创造出强大的巨型机器人，埃尔·雷·吉安特·罗博·朱尼尔，并释放它去摧毁敌方基地并取得胜利！故事 经过多年的制造混乱，人类终于放弃了地球，去寻找一个新的星球来破坏。被留下的机器中，有曾经忠诚服务于人类主人的机器人。其中就有机器人工程仓库（RED）和蓝光废弃塑料与金属公司的敌对机器人。除了这些，没有什么别的事情可做，这些现在没有领导的机器人将竞争升级为激烈的战斗。双方都在拼命收集材料，以创造出足够强大的巨型机器人来摧毁对方。《铁桶大乱斗》开始了！机器人角色 克兰西·格鲁特型号CLN-C可能头部挨了太多次打击、子弹和火箭，但他从不放弃。他总是乐于助人，克兰西可以迅速治疗队友或用他的自动步枪提供掩护火力。他没有携带废铁的花哨装置，因为他不需要。克兰西只需要一些老式的决心和他那金属机器人的手臂来回收废铁。黛西·工程师型号QT-3.14看起来可爱又开朗，但不要被她的外表欺骗了——黛西是一个制造痛苦和惩罚的技术专家。身材小巧的她指挥着一个强大的机甲套装，帮助她建造哨兵炮塔和携带无人机。而且她很乐意用她的滚筒炸弹发射器加入战斗。卡斯米·忍者型号KA5-M13最初是为非战斗目的而建造的。人类离开后，她终于可以追求成为忍者刺客的梦想，不过带有一些现代的转折。全息图、烟雾弹和一把赛博剑帮助她在敌人意识到发生了什么之前迅速地消灭他们。比约恩·野蛮人型号HPM4X身材魁梧，他充分利用了这一点。他冲向危险，用他强大的火焰喷射器消灭敌人。他的能量护盾即使在最糟糕的情况下也能让他存活下来，而且他如此强壮，可以轻松地将废铁扔给队友。瓦伦蒂娜·狙击手型号H0RN3T既冷静又致命。冷酷而冷静的她发现，在战斗中，远离敌人视线的地方是她最佳的定位。击倒敌人后，她用她的伸缩抓取爪从远处回收废铁。即使她的对手设法偷袭她，她也不会失去冷静，用眩晕手榴弹和短距离快速射击手枪来抵御他们。马弗里克·轰炸机型号DNGR-Z0N是个爱炫耀的人。他认为他的喷气背包让他高人一等，因此他养成了傲慢、自负的态度。他的喷气背包让他能够轻松进出战斗并进行轰炸。如果他不小心，马弗里克可能会发现自己处于危险之中。但他的敌人不知道的是，这正是他想要的。危险区域。当马弗里克似乎咬下了他无法咀嚼的东西时；他用他可靠的火箭发射器来平衡局势。他可以飞行，获得速度爆发，并向不幸的机器人下方投掷炸弹。,"GAMEPLAY DESCRIPTION Rustbucket Rumble is a side-scrolling, team-based, arena combat game. Players choose from 6 distinct robot characters of varying personality, ability, and weaponry, forming two teams of 3 robots. Players must work with their teammates to attack enemy robots until they are turned into bins of scrap, then transport the bins back to their base as scraps for recycling. It’s capture-the-flag where the players are the flags! Once a team has collected enough scraps, they can create the mighty giant robot, El Rey Gigante Robo Jr., and unleash him to destroy the enemy base and win! THE STORY After years of making a mess of things, mankind has finally given up and left Earth to find a new planet to trash. Left behind were the machines that once dutifully served their human masters. Among these were the robots of arch-rival companies Robotic Engineering Depot (RED) and Blucom Discarded Plastics and Metals. With nothing else to do, these now-leaderless robots escalated their competition into fierce combat. Both sides are now desperately collecting materials to create a giant robot powerful enough to destroy the other. The RUSTBUCKET RUMBLE has begun! ROBOT CLASSES Clancy Grunt Model CLN-C has probably taken one too many hits, bullets, and rockets to the head, but he never gives up. Always helpful, Clancy is quick to heal teammates or provide cover fire from his automatic rifle. He doesn’t have any fancy gadgets to carry scraps, because he doesn’t need them. All Clancy needs to retrieve scraps is just some good old fashion determination and his metal robot arms. Daisy Engineer Model QT-3.14 has a cute and cheerful appearance, but make no mistake — Daisy is a technician of pain and punishment. Small in stature, she commands a powerful mech suit to help her build sentry turrets and carry drones. And she’s happy to get into the fray with her roller bomb launcher. Kasumi Ninja Model KA5-M13 was originally built for non-combat purposes. After the humans left, she finally got to pursue her dream of being a ninja assassin, but with a modern twist. Holograms, smoke bombs, and a cyber sword help her quickly dismantle enemies before they even know what happened. Bjorn Brute Model HPM4X has an imposing stature and makes the most of it. Running head first into danger, he uses his powerful flamethrower to decimate enemies. His energy shield keeps him alive even in the worst conditions, and he’s so strong that he can easily toss scraps to his teammates. Valentina Sniper Model H0RN3T is as calm as she is deadly. Cold and calculating, she finds that the best place to position herself during combat is just out of sight from her foes. After dropping an enemy, she uses her extending grabber claw to retrieve scraps from afar. Even if her opponents do get the jump on her, she never loses her cool and uses stun grenades and a short range rapid-fire pistol to hold them off. Maverick Bombardier Model DNGR-Z0N is a show-off. Thinking his jetpack puts him above the competition, he’s developed a cocky, prideful demeanor. His jetpack allows him to maneuver in and out of combat with ease and perform bombing runs. If he’s not careful, then Maverick may find himself in dangerous situations. But little do his foes know, that’s right where he wants to be. The danger zone. And when it seems like Maverick has bitten off more than he can chew; he uses his trusty rocket launcher to help even the odds. He can fly, get a burst of speed, and drop a number of bombs to the unfortunate robots below.","“我非常喜欢这款游戏” GIGA： GeekMagazine “游戏具有快节奏的氛围,为类 2D 跑枪风格游戏的粉丝提供了怀旧因素” PC 游戏爱好者","“I thoroughly enjoyed the game, it was accessible but challenging.

In the Pause Between the Ringing,In the Pause Between the Ringing,In the Pause Between the Ringing 是来自 Somewhere 世界的短篇小说。一位名叫 Iqbal 的发明家和印度第一座电话矿的故事。在一个用电话线缝合的国家，发现电话的历史首先写在一本《地质学》一书中也就不足为奇了。毕竟，电话是印度景观中引人注目的固定装置。长期以来，它铿锵有力的响声预示着人们命运的突然而重大的变化。可以找到这种乐器，从 Chenab 崎岖不平的边缘放大了 Babur 军队的可怕号角。或者与 Chalukya 工匠的呐喊声咔嗒作响，这些呐喊声曾经在 Badami 神庙中回荡。它甚至随着时间的推移而听到，就像阿育王铭文的凿刻声，表现为詹姆斯·普林塞普 （James Prinsep） 内耳中未解决的铃声。或者当威廉·布鲁克·奥肖内西 （William Brooke O'Shaughnessy） 相信，就像霍乱肆虐的静脉一样，这些电报电缆可以让他将恢复剂直接注入一个动荡国家的心脏。在这个电话和电线的国家，电话簿成为家谱，电话交换机成为朝圣之地，机器的嗡嗡声和咔嗒声——这片土地零星历史的节拍器。我们的故事是在这种纠缠不清的电缆和时间中讲述的。当 Iqubal 等待电话时，他不断的停顿迫使人们回忆起印度电话的可怕历史。,"In the Pause Between the Ringing is a short story from the world of Somewhere . The story of an inventor called Iqbal and of the first telephone mines in India. In a country stitched with telephone wires, it is not surprising to discover that a history of the telephone was first written in a book of Geology. The telephone is after all a noticeable fixture of the Indian landscape. And it's sonorous ringing has long heralded sudden and momentous changes in the minute destinies of its people. The instrument can be found, amplifying the terrifying horns of Babur's army from the ragged edge of Chenab . Or clattering with the shouts of Chalukya craftsmen, that once echoed along the Badami temples. It is even heard across time, like the chiseling of Ashoka's inscriptions that would manifest as an unresolved ringing in the inner ear of James Prinsep. Or when William Brooke O'Shaughnessy believed that, much like cholera riddled veins, these telegraph cables would let him pump restoratives straight into the heart of a troubled nation. In this country of telephones and wires, phone directories become genealogies, telephone exchanges become places of pilgrimage and the ringing, clicking drone of its machinery - a metronome of the sporadic history of this land.

GTFO,GTFO,当囚禁你的神秘实体 The Warden 发布新的工作命令时，你的囚犯团队被放入 Rundown。The Rundown 是一系列的探险，每一次都会带你更深入地进入一个名为 The Complex 的腐朽研究设施。你一层一层地下降，搜寻工具和资源，帮助你在危险的隧道网络中生存，可怕的生物潜伏在每个阴影中。完成所有探险以完成 Work Order 并清除 Rundown。Go Away 专为四人囚犯团队设计，将合作作为体验的核心。如果您缺少一两个玩家，机器人可以填补您的阵容。他们会跟随你进行探险，在你偷偷摸摸的时候偷偷摸摸，收集资源，并和你并肩作战。他们是一个很好的后备，但 go away 中的沟通和战术战斗水平意味着最好与人一起玩。清除 Rundown 需要一个策略。在您进入 The Complex 之前，您的团队需要决定要携带哪些装备、助推器和武器。您还必须平衡团队，确定每个囚犯的职能，以便您知道在出现问题时该怎么做。他们会的。他们总是这样做。潜行和协调对于您在 The Complex 中机动时生存是必要的。Go Away 中的许多生物都处于冬眠状态，因此光线、噪音和振动很容易唤醒这些沉睡者。如果他们中的一个人知道你在那儿，他们都知道。那时事情就会变得一团糟。当狗屎撞到风扇时，你需要重型武器和清晰的头脑。检查你的火线，迫使他们通过瓶颈，设置你的杀戮区，并抓住一切机会重新装填。这些生物不惜一切代价，您也不应该。一旦混乱开始，你别无选择，只能放下他们中的每一个。清除探险和破败将奖励您新的装饰装备。自豪地佩戴它，因为它向你的同龄人证明你去过地狱又回来了。另一方面，沉睡者不会在乎一秒钟。,"Your team of prisoners is dropped into the Rundown when a new Work Order is issued by The Warden, the mysterious entity holding you captive. The Rundown is a series of expeditions, each one taking you deeper into a decayed research facility called The Complex. You descend level by level, scavenging tools and resources that help you survive in a perilous network of tunnels where gruesome creatures lurk in every shadow. Complete all the expeditions to fulfill the Work Order and clear the Rundown. GTFO is designed for prisoner teams of four, putting cooperation at the core of the experience. Bots can fill your lineup if you’re short one or two players. They’ll follow you through expeditions, sneak when you sneak, collect resources, and fight alongside you. They’re a good fallback, but the level of communication and tactical combat in GTFO means it’s best to play with people. A strategy is necessary to clear the Rundown. Before you drop into The Complex, your team needs to decide what gear, boosters, and weapons to bring. You must also balance the team, identifying the function of each prisoner so that you know what to do when things go wrong. And they will. They always do. Stealth and coordination are necessary to survive as you maneuver through The Complex. Many of the creatures of GTFO are suspended in a state of hibernation, so light, noise, and vibrations can easily wake up these Sleepers. And if one of them knows you’re there, they all know. That’s when things get messy. You’ll need heavy weaponry and a clear mind when the shit hits the fan. Check your line of fire, force them through bottlenecks, set up your kill zones and reload every chance you get. These creatures stop at nothing, and neither should you. Once the mayhem starts, you have no choice but to put every last one of them down. Clearing expeditions and Rundowns will reward you with new cosmetic gear. Wear it with pride, as it proves to your peers you’ve been to hell and back. The Sleepers, on the other hand, will not care for a second.","“游戏变得越来越精简,但 go away 是朝着相反方向迈出的响亮而自豪的一步” 8/10 – IGN “这是一部不容错过的幽闭恐惧症作品” 8/10 – EDGE “go away 拥有我在游戏中遇到的最一致、最精致的氛围。”多边形","“Games have become increasingly streamlined, but GTFO is a loud, proud step in the reverse direction” 8/10 – IGN “it's a work of unmissable claustrophobia” 8/10 – EDGE “GTFO has, bar none, the most consistent and polished atmosphere I’ve ever encountered in a game.” Polygon"
