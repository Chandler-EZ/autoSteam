Each day you construct your defenses, train troops, and prepare for attack. When enemies come in the night, you defend with towers, troops, and heroes with powerful abilities! Save as many towns as you can, while you travel through the Vale. Choose wisely, because each town unlocks unique assets and a hero to aid in future battles. Defeat is not the end in Valeguard. Each play you can unlock more heroes and discover new strategies to achieve victory! Build in the day and defend at night The quiet hamlets of the Vale stand defenseless. As the ValeGuard you act as mayor, merchant, and general for each village. Balance your workforce to provide food, housing, troops, and fortifications. When enemies threaten your villages, take on the role of commander with pause-able, real-time combat. Gather resources, craft weapons, and train troops Juggling resources is key to success in ValeGuard. Wood and iron are required to craft weapons. These weapons are then used to create troops or towers. Trade with merchants and buy items on the black market Gold is the most valuable of all resources and cannot be mined. Trade wisely and spend your gold carefully to ensure you have the funds you need. Random events and levels make each play unique Pumpkin patches, graveyards, wizard towers, and other town features can alter the way a town is managed and defended. Navigating nightly events can mean avoiding a deadly fight, or acquiring a magical item. Sometimes risk pays off while other times caution is wisest. Hop from town to town as you travel across the map of the Vale Each town provides a new hero, technology, and bump to starting resources. Not all villages will survive the war and when a town is destroyed, these perks are lost with it. Choose each town carefully to balance your party and defensive strategy for the long-term. Build walls, towers, and traps to defend your village There are many ways to defend a village in ValeGuard. Adapt, and uses what defenses are available to best support your heroes. Unlock new heroes through special events and quests Start the game with a single hero class and unlock rare and powerful heroes as you play. With more hero options you can begin to build a more balanced and powerful party. Upgrade Units With Armor and Mounts Towers are dependable and simpler to build but are static and don't gain experience. Troops are more demanding but can be moved to defend where needed. Troops can also be upgraded with armor, mounts, and gain levels with experience. Confront the dark generals in a final epic battle The final confrontation is difficult and success depends on a successful campaign. All your choices of tech, upgrades, heroes, and more will determine if you can hold out in the final battle.","“ValeGuard 具有吸引人且引人入胜的游戏循环” PCGamesN “[抢先体验] 一款具有实时战略战斗的回合制城市建设游戏。白天建造你的城市,晚上用英雄、士兵和塔楼进行防御。Preedural lands,强烈推荐。FallenShogun Gaming “ValeGuard 真的达到了最佳位置,其复杂性恰到好处,可以让游戏保持有趣,而不会太多。”独立观察","“ValeGuard has an attractive and compelling gameplay loop” PCGamesN “[EARLY ACCESS] A turn-based city builder with real-time strategic combat.

濒死体验,Near Death Experience,Near Death Experience 是一款毫无防备的恐怖游戏，让您置身于一位失去记忆的车祸受害者的脑海中，发现自己处于一个充满威胁和未知的区域。玩家必须解开谜语，试图在逃离黑暗力量的同时恢复记忆。注意：第一关会有点困难！是一个谜语：角色生活的片段是照片，天使的尖叫是你在关卡中会听到的奇怪声音。只有有声音，照片才会出现！,"Near Death Experience is a defensless horror game that puts you in the mind of a car crash victim that lost his memory and finds himself in a threatening and unknown area.

末日帝国,Armageddon Empires,"注意：这款游戏最初于 2007 年发布，屏幕分辨率固定为 1024×768，最佳窗口模式运行。游戏安装文件夹中包含全屏可执行文件，会拉伸以适应宽屏显示器，包括《废土邪教》和《矛头》扩展包。《末日帝国》是一款电脑回合制策略游戏，它融合了集换式卡牌游戏（不用担心，无需追逐卡牌，你会获得所有卡牌）、棋盘游戏和电脑游戏的最佳元素，带来独特的互动策略战争游戏体验。你可以选择普通大小的地图，与单个 AI 对手进行死亡竞赛，在一小时内结束，或者选择巨大地图，与其他 3 个派系进行史诗般的激烈战斗。玩家首先选择四个派系之一并构建自己的牌组，每个派系都有独特的玩法风格、优势和劣势。有 7 种主要卡牌类型：英雄、单位、设施、攻击（飞机、直升机 / 悬浮机和导弹）、附件、弹药、战术。游戏地图每次游玩时随机生成，并分布有资源和独立单位与设施。玩家通过消耗资源储备来出牌，在这个严酷的新世界中，建造帝国需要 4 种基本资源：人力、材料、能源和技术，它们都分布在游戏棋盘上，有些集中在人类城市的废墟中，有些在被遗忘的战场的垃圾堆中，或简单地埋在广阔的废土中。游戏开始后，你会想部署英雄和单位并探索地图，一些六边形格子会包含资源，一些会隐藏独立单位，这些单位和设施从人类奴隶贩子、袭击者和雇佣兵到外星军阀、 rogue 机器智囊和变异怪物不等。根据你的派系，有些会主动提出加入你的事业（可能需要代价），而有些则会与你战斗至死。侦察完地图、定位敌人并组建军队后，你会想发动战争。一切都需要行动点，所以要好好计划你的行动，或许你想先用一些空中力量削弱敌人。从手牌中打出攻击卡牌，可对位于你的要塞和前哨范围内的敌军发动攻击，拖动飞机、导弹或直升机（悬浮船）卡牌并将其放置在敌人编队上，战斗即开始。你的卡牌攻击强度由水平滚动区域的骰子表示，目标的防御强度由下方滚动区域的骰子表示，每个骰子有 3 面带有派系符号表示成功，3 面空白表示失败。双方掷骰子，计算成功次数，然后尝试修改结果，一些飞机以及所有英雄都有命运点，可用于重掷任何失败的空对地骰子，战术卡牌可大幅改变结果 —— 为你的骰子池添加正面骰子、重掷对手骰子、将其转为失败甚至移除。如果攻击者掷出的点数高于防御者，则差值作为伤害应用。军队在棋盘上由矩形棋子表示，每支军队可包含 1 名英雄和最多 8 个单位（卡牌），但必须注意不要超过英雄的指挥评级，否则其攻击、防御和移动将受到影响。当两个非隐形军队在一个六边形格子相遇时，战斗开始，这些战斗可包含多支军队，因此首先让你确定战斗顺序。战斗是军队对军队，直到一方被摧毁、溃败（仅剩下领袖）或被其所有者撤退。在战场上留下有战斗能力军队的玩家是胜利者，并获得该六边形格子的控制权。任何幸存的被击败单位若选择撤退，将遭受撤退攻击，其英雄可能在溃败中被俘或被杀。俘虏敌方英雄特别有利，因为他们会被关押在最近的友方要塞或前哨，每回合为玩家生成 1 点额外行动点。地面战斗是残酷的事情，就像空中攻击一样，你的卡牌攻击强度由水平滚动区域的骰子表示，目标的防御强度由下方滚动区域的骰子表示，双方掷骰子，计算成功次数，然后尝试修改结果。如果攻击掷骰大于防御掷骰，则差值作为伤害施加给防御者。一旦一个单位攻击或执行特殊能力，它就会被标记为已行动，直到下一回合才能采取进一步行动。玩家轮流攻击或使用能力，直到回合结束，然后双方都有机会评估情况，可以选择撤回当前活跃的地面战斗军队（每个单位都会受到一次免费攻击）、撤退所有军队（同样会受到免费攻击，并且会尝试俘虏 / 杀死任何军队中没有单位的英雄）或继续战斗。如果双方都选择撤退，则不会受到免费攻击。要在废土的斗争中获胜，你必须占领或摧毁每个敌人的要塞，这听起来很简单，但有许多路径可以实现这一目标。你可以发动残酷直接的地面战役，在实验室开发秘密武器并汽化敌人，或使用隐形和破坏来消灭敌人，选择权在你手中，但请记住，你的敌人也会对你采取行动，一颗好的核弹就足以毁了你的一天。

The screen resolution is fixed at 1024 by 768 and best played in a windowed mode. A full screen executable is included in the game's installation folder; it will stretch to fit wide screen monitors. Incudes: Cults of the Wasteland and Tip of the Spear expansions. Armageddon Empires is a computer turn based strategy game that takes the best elements of collectable card games (don’t worry there are no cards to chase you get them all), board games, and computer games and brings them all together to provide a unique interactive strategy war game experience. You can choose a normal size map and battle in a death match with a single AI opponent finishing within an hour or select a huge map and slug it out with the other 3 factions in a game of epic proportions. Players start by choosing one of four factions and building their playing decks. Each faction has its own play-style, strengths and weaknesses. There are 7 main card types: Heroes, Units, Facilities, Attack (Aircraft, Helo/Hover and Missile), Attachments, Munitions, Tactics. The game map is created randomly each time you play and seeded with resources and independent units and facilities. Your cards are played by drawing on your resource stockpiles. 4 basic resources are necessary to build your empire in the harsh new world. Humans, Materials, Energy and Technology are all strewn across the playing board. Some are concentrated in the ruins of human cities; others are found in the junk heaps of forgotten battlefields or simply lying buried in the vast wastes. Once the game is underway, you will want to deploy your heroes and units and explore the map. Some hexes will contain resources; some will harbor independents. These units and facilities range from human slavers, raiders and mercenaries to alien warlords, rogue machine masterminds and mutated monsters. Depending on your faction some will offer to join your cause (maybe for a price) while others will fight you to the death. With the map scouted out, your enemies located and your armies formed up, you will want to unleash the dogs of war. Everything costs Action Points, so plan your moves well. You might want to use some air power to soften up the enemy first. Attack cards are played from your hand and can strike enemy armies within range of your stronghold and outposts. Drag the Aircraft, Missile or Helo (Hover Ship) card and drop it on an enemy formation and the battle is joined. Your card’s attack strength is represented by die on the horizontal rolling area. The target’s defense strength is represented below yours by the die on the lower rolling area. Each die has 3 sides with the faction’s symbol denoting a success and 3 sides that are blank denoting failure. Both players roll their dice, count up their successes and then try and modify the results. Some aircraft as well as all heroes have fate points they can spend to re-roll Air to groundany die that failed. Tactic cards can be played to drastically change the results…add positive die to your pool, re-roll opponent’s die, turn them to failures, or even remove them. If the attacker rolls higher than the defender then the difference is applied as damage. Armies are represented by rectangular playing pieces on the board. Each army can contain 1 hero and up to 8 units (cards) but you will have to be careful not to exceed your hero’s command rating or their attack, defense and movement will suffer. When two non-stealthed armies meet in a hex a battle ensues. These battles can encompass multiple stacks of armies so you are first given the chance to determine the order in which they will fight. Battles are army versus army until one side is destroyed, gutted (only a leader remains) or retreated by their owner. The player remaining on the battle field with a combat capable army is the winner and gains control of the hex. Any surviving defeated units are subjected to a retreat attack if they opted to retreat and their heroes may be captured or killed in the rout. Capturing enemy heroes is particularly advantageous as they are interred in the nearest friendly stronghold or outpost and generate 1 bonus Action Point per player turn. Ground Combat is a brutal affair. Just like air attacks, your card’s attack strength is represented by die on the horizontal rolling area. The target’s defense strength is represented below yours by the die on the lower rolling area. Both players roll their die, count the successes and then try and modify the results. If the attack roll is greater than the defense roll then the difference is applied as damage to the defender. Once a unit attacks or performs a special ability it is marked as committed and may not take any further actions until the next round. Players take turns attacking or playing abilities until the end of the round is reached. Both players then have the chance to assess the situation and either withdraw the currently active armyground combat (each unit is subjected to a free attack), retreat all armies (again a free attack is taken as well as a capture/kill attempt for any heroes without units in their army) or continue the fight. If both sides elect to retreat than no free attacks are taken. To win the struggle for the wasteland you must occupy or destroy each of your enemies’ strongholds. It sounds simple enough but there are many paths to achieve that objective. You can wage a brutal straight forward ground campaign, develop a secret weapon in your laboratories and vaporize your enemy, or use stealth and sabotage to eliminate your enemy. The choice is up to you but keep in mind your enemies will be moving against you as well. All it takes is one good nuke to ruin your day.","“归根结底,所有其他考虑因素都是次要的。这是一个关于有意义决定的游戏。第一个也是最有意义的决定,当然是玩演示并购买的东西。8/10 – EUROGAMER “Cryptic Comet 出色地捕捉了世界末日帝国的桌面战争游戏。”8.5/10 – 游戏幕府将军 “Cryptic Comet's Armageddon Empires 是一款电脑屏幕上的棋盘游戏。”7.5/10 – 游戏 Nexus","“All other considerations, ultimately, are secondary.

Scouting ahead and considering the options open to you makes for an experience that rewards more than it frustrates even if there is little sign of originality. Still, it’s not every day you get to play as an astronaut from another race.” Gameranx “Singular in focus, but sidestepping ennui with impressive variety in mission design, We Are The Dwarves is a surprise treat. I knew I would at least find it interesting from pre-release trailers, but never anticipated how much I would dig the entire package. A rich world, chunky and responsive combat, We Are The Dwarves doesn't, ahem, fall short in any area.” Wargamer"

But from the frozen north, a witch queen is leading her army on a quest for vengeance against the lords of Kalevala. Ancient ruins from the days when gods dwelled on the earth are opening to unleash forgotten powers, tempting humans and striving to overtake the world.

You must use your wits to control it as you’re drawn into the midst of a war between the city of Kalevala and the armies of the Northlanders driven by their witch queen Lowhee. Your task is to master the power, in order to use it for mankind’s protection, while your enemies will seek to harness it in the service of total destruction.

Patterns of lights executing a Danse Macabre on the walls is presented by a queer device on the table. Having recalled nothing other than that you’re in Upuaut, an Antarctic base located near the South Pole, you find the place deserted and have a distinct feeling of something being terribly wrong. Somehow knowing that your memories cannot guide you enforces a strange feeling of vulnerability, a familiar yet alien sensation of being a part of a peculiar whole... Soon you will discover that having used the device during the expedition, you have died but then returned subtly changed, speaking of strange memories and of strange places. You have lost something important or gained something sinister... Explore the Antarctic base, as well as dreams and visions.

SugarMill,SugarMill,将 SugarWinds 添加到您的愿望清单 / SugarMill 是一款沙盒村庄建设游戏。这个游戏发生在欧洲人在加勒比海定居的早期。它重于人员和建筑物的微观管理。以及经济和贸易方面。玩家从几个家庭和装满物资的仓库开始，您将尝试生存并繁荣您的定居点。您可以建立一个港口来进出口货物。但是，有一个称为“港口声誉”的指标，它将决定船舶访问您的港口的频率。此外，海盗就在身边，如果“海盗威胁”指标太高，您将输掉游戏。该游戏为该类型带来了许多新颖独特的功能，以下是主要功能的列表： 主要特点： 生产线生产：要制作简单的钉子，您需要开采矿石，在铸造厂熔化铁，最后在铁匠铺中制作钉子。或者如果你有足够的钱，你可以作弊，你总是可以直接从船上买钉子。产品过期：就像在现实生活中一样，在这个游戏中，每个产品都会过期。有些食品比其他食品过期得早。口渴：人们需要喝水才能生存。游戏的挑战之一是让他们解渴。（在现实生活中，我们只能在没有水的情况下存活 3 天）测量：准备好收集 300 公斤的木材和一些钉子来建造一个棚屋。你能猜出一座砖房需要多少钱吗？马车：由于游戏有真实的尺寸，人们只能携带这么多。这时马车就出现了。他们携带更多，因此，您的经济得到促进。一个处于最佳年龄的人可能会携带大约 15 公斤，独轮车接近 60 公斤，但较小的手推车可以携带 240 公斤。商品用途：板条箱、桶、手推车、手推车、工具、布料、陶器、家具和器皿都是进行城镇传统活动所必需的。随着这些商品的使用，它们会减少，因此，如果没有板条箱，一个人就不会携带任何东西。密切关注该;)幸福感： 人们的幸福感受多种因素的影响。食物种类、宗教满意度、休闲机会、房屋舒适度和教育水平。此外，如果一个人有餐具、陶器和布料，也会影响他们的幸福感。港口声誉：您可以执行传统的贸易活动，例如进出口任何产品。该指标确定船舶到达您港口的频率。海盗威胁：海盗就在附近。该指标确定遭受海盗攻击的风险。如果发生这种情况，游戏就结束了。您可以通过建造军事建筑来减少这种情况。建筑物：超过 50 种不同的建筑物可供建造。产品： 超过 80 种不同的产品。,"Add SugarWinds to your Wishlist / SugarMill is a sandbox village building game. The game happens in the early days when Europeans were settling in the Caribbean. It's heavy on person and buildings micromanagement. As well as an economical and trading aspect. The player starts with a few families and storage full of supplies, you will try to survive and thrive your settlement. You can build a port to import and export goods. However, there is an indicator called 'Port Reputation', this will dictate how often ships will visit your port. Also, pirates are around, if the 'Pirate Threat' indicator goes too high you will lose the game. The game brings many new and unique features to the genre, below is a list of the main ones: Main Features: Line production: To make a simple nail you need to mine ore, in the foundry melt the iron, and finally in the blacksmith make the nail. Or you can cheat if you got enough money, you can always buy the nail directly from a ship. Products expiration: Just like in real life, in this game every product expires. Some food items expire sooner than others. Thirst: People need to drink water to survive. One of the challenges of the game is to keep their thirst quenched. (In real life we can only survive 3 days without water) Measurements: Be ready to gather 300KG of wood, and some nails to build a shack. Can you guess how much is needed for a brick house? Horse Carriages: As the game has real measurements people can carry only so much. That's when horse-drawn carriages come into place. They carry a lot more, as a result, your economy gets boosted. A person in their best years might carry around 15KG, wheelbarrows closer to 60KG, but the smaller cart can carry 240KG. Usage of goods: Crates, barrels, wheelbarrows, carts, tools, cloth, crockery, furniture and utensils are all needed to do the traditional activities of a town. As these goods get used, they diminish, as a result, a person won't carry anything if there are no crates. Keep an eye on that ;) Happiness: People's happiness is influenced by various factors. Food variety, religion satisfaction, access to leisure, house comfort and education level. Also if a person has utensils, crockery and cloth will influence their happiness. Port reputation: You can perform traditional trade activities such as importing and exporting any product. This indicator identifies how often ships come to your port. Pirate threat: Pirates are around. This indicator identifies the risks of suffering a pirate attack. If it happens is game over. You can decrease this by constructing military buildings. Buildings: Over 50 different buildings to construct. Products: Over 80 different products.","“SugarMill 是一款有趣的热带城市建设策略游戏,微观管理（道路结构、建筑、存储）和经济方面（资源、贸易......不同难度,好游戏“ 推荐 – 游戏奶奶 ”其实是一个非常酷的游戏“ Gray 仍然玩 ”只是整个氛围相当不错“ 喀拉拉利斯","“SugarMill is an interesting tropical city builder strategy game, micromanagement (road structure, building, storage), and economic aspect (resource, trade..)

超空间之门,Hypergate,我能期待什么？Hypergate 包括一个 2 小时的单人战役，以及一个即时行动模式，用于构建您自己的自定义战斗场景。Instant Action 可以单人游戏或与朋友通过 LAN 玩。该活动包括一个简短的教程任务。在前几个任务中引入了额外的游戏机制。游戏包括 14 个不同的太空战斗地点、24 种不同的飞船升级（每个类别 6 个：盾牌、枪支、导弹和冷却剂）、6 个其他可升级的增强功能和 3 个战斗机可供飞行。支持第一人称和第三人称视角。敌人属于两个不同派系中的任何一个，包括战斗机、各种大小的炮塔、大型巡洋舰和增援门。最大的太空战斗可能包括数十艘巡洋舰和数百架战斗机。该游戏的客户评论指出，Hypergate 的战斗风格类似于 Freespace 2 或 Star Wars： X-Wing。Hypergate 包括完整的控制器、键盘和鼠标支持。可以自定义控件以适应玩家的偏好。显示器支持包括 13 种不同的分辨率，包括超宽屏幕格式。使用自动调平飞行，或手动控制俯仰、滚动和偏航。考虑到了大量玩家的反馈，以提供扎实的游戏内飞行体验。该游戏还包括 30 项 Steam 成就、全球 Steam 排行榜和 Steam 云存档，可在您的设备之间同步您的任务进度和升级。我不能期待什么？Hypergate 没有研磨、资源平衡或小行星采矿。只需点击三下鼠标，您就可以开始一项任务并通过击杀敌人来开始赚取积分。飞行方式是非牛顿的。（当前）不支持双 HOTAS。游戏有在线 DRM 吗？不。它曾经是，但最终在 2020 年 3 月应玩家要求被删除。最终，我希望玩家喜欢 Hypergate，而不是因为遇到互联网问题而受到惩罚。是否计划更新？是的。已发布两个主要更新： 内容更新 #1 和内容更新 #2 。这些更新中的大部分内容都是根据玩家的要求和兴趣来确定优先级的。内容更新 #3 的额外 2 小时单人战役任务目前正在开发中。内容更新 #3 的计划发布日期是 2021 年末的某个时间。更新是常规游戏更新，而不是单独的 DLC。想要了解更多信息？查看即将推出的内容和功能的最佳方式是查看我的 Twitter 页面 ，该页面几乎专门用于 Hypergate GIF。我大约每隔几天发布一次新的 GIF。同样，我的开发博客重点介绍了重要的更新并概述了我的开发理念。也请考虑加入新创建的 Hypergate Discord 服务器，与我自己或现有玩家讨论 Hypergate。,"What Can I Expect? Hypergate includes a 2-hour single-player campaign, and an Instant Action mode for building your own custom battle scenarios. Instant Action can be played single-player or over LAN with friends. The campaign includes a brief, simple tutorial mission. Additional game mechanics are introduced over the first few missions. The game includes 14 different space-based battle locations, 24 different upgrades for your ship (6 for each category: shields, guns, missiles, and coolant), 6 other upgradeable enhancements, and 3 fighters to fly. Both 1st-person and 3rd-person view are supported. Enemies belong to either one of two different factions, and include fighters, turrets of various sizes, large cruisers, and reinforcement gates. The largest possible space battles can include dozens of cruisers and hundreds of fighters. Customer reviews for this game have stated that Hypergate's combat style is similar to Freespace 2 or Star Wars: X-Wing. Hypergate includes full controller, keyboard, and mouse support. Controls can be customized to suit player preference. Monitor support includes 13 different resolutions, including ultra-widescreen formats. Fly with auto-leveling, or control pitch, roll, and yaw manually. Considerable player feedback has been taken into account to provide a solid in-game flying experience. The game also includes 30 Steam Achievements, a global Steam Leaderboard, and Steam Cloud Saves to sync your mission progress and upgrades across your devices. What Can I Not Expect? Hypergate has no grinding, resource balancing, or asteroid mining. In as little as three mouse clicks, you can begin a mission and start earning points by scoring kills against enemies. Flight style is non-Newtonian. Dual HOTAS is (currently) not supported. Does the Game Have Online DRM? No. It used to, but it was ultimately removed March 2020 on player requests. Ultimately, I want players to enjoy Hypergate and not be punished for having Internet problems. Are Updates Planned? Yes. Two major updates have already been released: Content Update #1 , and Content Update #2 . Most of the content in these updates were prioritized based on player requests and interest. An additional 2 hours of single-player campaign missions is also currently under development for Content Update #3. The planned release date of Content Update #3 is some time in late 2021. Updates are regular game updates and not separate DLC. Want to Learn More?

ROSE Online,ROSE Online,我们不知道 Arua 来自哪里，也不知道她是如何成为的。然而，我们确实知道，在 Arua 之前什么都不存在。生命、灵魂和所有存在的女神按照她认为合适的方式创造了宇宙......一个平静而美丽的地方，灵魂可以安居。宇宙的深层物质孕育着生命的波浪，所有生物都会在上面舒缓地摇曳。这个完美的宇宙被称为灵魂之海。生命将以七颗行星的形式为灵魂之海带来光芒。Arua 出于爱创造了这些，并将每一个都献给了她为之注入生命的居民。“行星，就像你的生命一样，亲爱的，都是你的。我也是。你们的灵魂也是。这些是 Arua 的话，当他们出生时，这些话在每个人的心中响起。“我把神赐给你，让它们看顾你。好好赞美他们，因为没有一种爱能比得上你从他们那里得到的爱。因此，众神被创造出来，守护着 Arua 在七颗行星中创造的所有生命。Arua 以照顾他们的每一位众神和女神的名字命名了这些行星：Junon、Lunar、Eldeon、Orlo、Karkia、Skaaj 和 Hebarn。每个星球的居民都过着幸福的生活，崇拜各自的上帝或女神，并陶醉于生活在他们的保护和统治下带来的乐趣。但一切都不是很和谐。黑暗之神 Hebarn 从其他星球解散，他摧毁 Arua 宇宙的阴谋开始了。很快，关于陌生访客的八卦开始了。天外来客保护生命，并从所有错误中伸出正义。他们是神圣的存在;他们很少忍受饥饿或口渴，他们不需要像大多数其他生物那样多的睡眠，但他们会受伤，他们可以爱。他们可以提供帮助。毕竟，这就是 Arua 创建它们的原因 主要特点： 自定义您的游戏玩法 您选择最适合您的游戏类型的统计数据和技能，每个职业都有多个技能树选项，让您获得属于自己的体验。玩家创造自己的传奇 ROSE Online 中的任务会受到用户社区活动的影响。你关注谁;Arua 还是 Hebarn？定制你的卡通 你不仅限于丑陋的盔甲或单一的外观，当你选择与怪物战斗或与他人进行 PvP 时，你可以把你的卡通装扮成你想要的任何东西。在 PvP 期间与机甲城堡装备战斗时，您可以看起来像一个大果冻豆，这完全取决于您。与朋友组队不仅可以让您像传统 MMO 一样受益，还可以获得更多的经验值，并且凭借有助于派对的玩家技能，乐趣也会大大增加！,"We don't know where Arua came from, nor how she came to be. We do know, however, that nothing existed before Arua. The Goddess of life, souls, and all existence created the universe as she saw fit… a calm and beautiful place where souls could dwell peacefully. The deep matters of the universe cradled the waves of life, on which all beings would sway soothingly. This perfect universe was called the Sea of Souls. Life would bring shine to the Sea of Souls, in the form of seven planets. Arua created these out of love, and dedicated each of them to the inhabitants that she breathed life into. 'The planets, as your lives, dear ones, are all yours. As am I. As are your souls.' These are the words of Arua that ring in everyone's hearts when they are born. 'To you, I give the Gods, to watch over you. Praise them well, for no love can ever match the one you will receive from them.' And thus, the Gods were created, to watch over all life that Arua had created among the seven planets. And Arua named the planets after each of the Gods and Goddesses that would look after them: Junon, Lunar, Eldeon, Orlo, Karkia, Skaaj, and Hebarn. Each planet's inhabitants lived in happiness, idolizing their respective God or Goddess, and reveling in the pleasures that living under their protection and rule brought. But all was not harmonious for long. The Dark God Hebarn disbanded from the other planets, and his plots to destroy Arua's universe began. Soon, the gossips about strange visitors started. The Visitors protect life, and make right from all that is wrong. They are divine beings; they seldom suffer from hunger or thirst, they do not need as much sleep as most other creatures, but they can hurt, they can love. And they can help. That is why Arua created them, after all Key Features: Customize Your Game Play You pick your stats and skills that best fit your type of game play with multiple skill tree options for each class that allows for an experience that is your own. Players Make their Own Legend The quests in ROSE Online are affected by the activities of the user community. Who do you follow; Arua or Hebarn? Customize Your Toon You are not confined to ugly armors or a single look, you can outfit your toon to be just about anything you want to look like while you pick fights with monsters or engage others in PvP. You can look like a large Jelly Bean while fighting a Mech Castle Gear during PvP it is all up to you. Party Play Grouping with your friends doesn't just allow you to benefit like a traditional MMO, but you earn vastly more EXP and with player skills that help with the Party the enjoyment is vastly increased as well!","“Rose Online 拥有出色的图形和丰富的内容,可以让玩家保持兴趣。快速的练级和简单的游戏玩法为 Rose 提供了良好的节奏“ – MMOHut ”这个世界上弥漫着一种可爱,感觉是一种快乐。您可能会在游戏中浪费数小时,尤其是在初次涉足世界时。“ – GameZone","“Rose Online has great graphics and plenty of content to keep players interested.

3D 地球缩时壁纸,3D Earth Time Lapse PC Live Wallpaper,"《3D 地球缩时壁纸》仅支持 Windows 10/11 系统！我们每天都在屏幕上看到壁纸，除了提升分辨率，它们多年来并未改变。如今我们拥有强大的设备，而壁纸仍只是平面图片。我们的计划很简单：将壁纸提升到新高度。《3D 地球缩时壁纸》是一个模拟国际空间站（ISS）视角的项目，作为互动壁纸显示在 Windows 图标和窗口下方。因此，每次你的壁纸都将独一无二，并随时响应指令！你可以改变环绕地球的方向、高度或速度，选择任何国家后会显示其名称，让你始终清楚所在位置。该壁纸还具备地球相对太阳的定位系统，当你所在地是夜晚时，壁纸也会呈现夜晚。你也可以手动设置昼夜变化速率。地球由高质量 16K 纹理构建，可看到湖泊或河流等细节，夜晚则能看到道路和城市的夜景灯光，此外还有风暴或极光等效果。项目包含大多数国家，你可以高亮显示并按需飞往目标国家。3DM Live Wallpapers 不对所有国家的边界和名称的正确映射 / 变更负责，我们并非国家划分体系的创造者。“游戏模式” 按钮可在你想玩普通游戏时停止壁纸运行，这将使壁纸不占用 CPU 和显卡资源，让你能如常游戏，之后再返回独特的壁纸视角。壁纸拥有丰富菜单，可更改相机模式和效果、图形设置等。壁纸特色：16K 地球地图分辨率；全飞行控制；实时或手动太阳位置与速度；带名称、边界和最大城市的互动国家；用于停止壁纸以玩普通游戏的游戏模式按钮；查看整个地球的地球模式；不同的地球位置；飞往你国家的主页按钮；图形设置；飞行物体；更多细节如雷暴、极光、移动云层；可能还有更多…… 且会不断增加；) 仅支持 WINDOWS 10！多屏幕用户：建议使用相同尺寸的屏幕，壁纸将自动适配多屏幕，菜单可拖动，现在你可以将其放置在任何位置。为获得最佳体验，你可将地球位置设置在一侧，使地球仅显示在一个屏幕上。如何关闭此壁纸？要关闭此项目，可选择菜单内的 “关闭应用” 按钮，也可运行 “游戏模式” 并使用右上角的 “X”。互动壁纸如何工作？互动壁纸的工作方式与普通游戏类似，但显示在 Windows 系统的图标和窗口下方，壁纸始终活跃，让你始终拥有独特视角。与标准 “平面” 壁纸不同，它始终呈现不同内容，是一个可供互动的 3D 环境，允许你影响其外观。我可以用此壁纸玩游戏吗？当然！为将处理器和显卡使用率几乎降至 0，你可随时 “暂停” 壁纸，结束游戏后再返回。在处理大型项目或渲染时也建议这样做。遗憾的是，目前无法自动化此过程。PC 资源消耗：由于是 3D 应用，必然会占用资源。我们考虑到这一点，因此将保持低需求作为首要任务。《3D 地球缩时壁纸》也出现在移动设备（Android）上，在中端手机上运行良好。壁纸还具备图形设置，可限制某些效果，就像在游戏中一样，你可根据 PC 硬件设置选项。为何选择地球？这个想法源于多年前我观看国际空间站（ISS）的记录，景色令人惊叹，但我渴望一种…… 飞行控制的自由。图形引擎允许更多功能，例如互动国家，于是这个项目应运而生……;) 项目会持续开发吗？当然，我们仍有想法，有时用户也会分享想法，我们会尝试在更新中添加。遗憾的是，我们受 PC 资源使用限制，无法实现所有想法。例如，我们可以使用 64K 纹理！（原文如此！），但项目仅作为 “壁纸” 就可能占用近 4GB 空间；d 支持：我们是一个小型团队，希望创建互动应用，为知名的 Windows 壁纸增添多样性。我们努力使每个项目独特，为你的屏幕带来新内容。每一份支持对我们都很宝贵，评分和评论帮助我们前进，制作更好的互动壁纸。《3D 地球缩时壁纸》是我们在 Steam 平台的首个项目，但我们承诺，有了你的支持，将推出更多真正独特的项目。祝你飞行愉快！
","WINDOWS 10/11 ONLY! We see the wallpapers on our screen every day. Apart from increasing the resolution, they have not changed for many years. Today we have powerful devices and wallpaper is still a flat picture. Our plan is simple! take the wallpapers to a new level. 3D Earth Time Lapse PC is a project that simulates the view from the International Space Station ISS which acts as an interactive wallpaper that is displayed under Windows icons and windows. Thanks to this, each time your wallpaper will be unique and ready for your instructions! You can change the direction, height or speed of orbiting to the ground. After selecting any country, its name will be displayed so you will always know where you are. 3D Earth Time Lapse PC also has a system of positioning the earth relative to the sun. When you have the night and the wallpaper in the place where you live it will also be the night. You can also manually set the rate of the day and night changes. The land is built of high-quality 16K textures on which you can see details like lakes or rivers and at night we will see the night lights of roads and cities. In addition, the land has effects like storms or auroras. The project contains most of the countries that you can highlight and choose your own to fly to it on demand. 3DM Live Wallpapers is not responsible for correct mapping/changes of borders and names of all countries. We are not the creators of the system of division into countries. The 'Game Mode' button will allow you to stop the wallpaper when you want to play the normal game. This will cause the wallpaper will not drill down on the CPU and video card. Thanks to this you can play as always and then return to your wallpaper and unique views. The wallpaper has an extensive menu where you can change the modes and effects of the camera, graphics settings and many more. Wallpaper Features &gt; 16k Earth Maps Resolution. &gt; Full Flight Control. &gt; Real-time Or Manual Sun Position and Speed. &gt; Interactive countries with names, borders and the biggest cities. &gt; Game Mode button to stop wallpaper to play normal games. &gt; Globe mode to see all the earth. &gt; Different globe position. &gt; Home button to fly to your country. &gt; Graphics settings. &gt; Flying objects. &gt; More details like thunderstorms, Aurora, moving clouds. &gt; Probably something more ... and will be more ;) WINDOWS 10 ONLY! Multi-screen Users: We recommend using the same size screens. The wallpaper will be automatically fitted to your multi-screens. The menu is draggable so now you can place it where do you want. For the best experience, you can set earth position on one side to keep the earth at only one screen. How to Turn Off This Wallpaper?: To turn off this project you can select 'Close the app' button inside the menu. Also, you can run 'Game Mode' and use 'X' in the right top corner. How Do Interactive Wallpapers Work? Interactive wallpaper works just like a normal game, but it is displayed under icons and windows of the Windows system. The wallpaper is active all the time so that you always have a unique view. Unlike standard 'flat' wallpapers, this one will always be something else. A 3D environment posed for interaction, which allows you to influence its appearance. Can I Play Games With This Wallpaper? Of course! To reduce almost to 0 using the processor and graphics card at any time you can 'pause' the wallpaper and return to it when you finish playing. Also recommended when working on larger projects or renderings. Unfortunately, at the present moment, it is not possible to automate this process. Consumption Of Pc Resources As it is a 3D application it must take its own. We have this in mind and therefore maintaining low demand is our priority. 3D Earth Time Lapse PC also appears on mobile devices (Android) and works great on medium range phones. The wallpaper also has graphics settings so you can limit some effects. Just like in games, you can set options for your PC hardware. Why Earth? The idea came up years ago when I watched recordings from the ISS International Space Station. The views are amazing but I missed one ... freedom of flight control. The graphics engine allows more, for example, interactive countries. And that's how the project was made ...;) Do the Project Will Be Developed Of course, we still have ideas and sometimes users themselves share their ideas with us that we will try to add in the amendments. Unfortunately, we are very limited by the use of PC resources so we can not implement all ideas. For example, we could use texture 64k! (sic!) but the project would take almost 4GB when it's just a 'wallpaper' ;d Support We are a tiny team that wants to create interactive applications that diversify well-known Windows wallpapers. We try to make each project unique, bringing something new to your screen. Every support is valuable to us. Ratings and comments help us move forward and make even better interactive wallpapers. 3D Earth Time Lapse PC is our first project on the Steam platform, but we promise that with your support there will be more truly unique projects.

LOGistICAL,LOGistICAL,《LOGistICAL》是一款大型开放世界策略+运输解谜游戏，融合了城市经营、物流调度与生产管理元素。你的任务是在真实比例的地图上，通过规划运输路线、建设产业、升级车辆，逐步完成上千个城市的货物供给目标。每座城镇就是一个独立的谜题，整个国家乃至全球地图则构成一个宏大的物流挑战。,"LOGistICAL is a large open-world, strategy, puzzle game where you transport different cargoes to complete all the towns throughout the country. The whole game is a huge puzzle while each town is its own little piece of puzzling. There are over 1,000 towns to complete. Plenty of towns are easy enough. Some take complex planning. Do them in your own order. Get bonuses for completing regions and contracts. Some cargoes are easy to get. Others you have to create in industries. Use existing industries and build your own. The further you get from the start the more strategies you have to use. Pimp up your trucks with bonuses. Last truck delivering gets the bonus. The towns and map are to scale. Current or historical industry placement. You could even say that playing is educational. There Is Plenty More to Keep You On Your toes. Towns consume the cargoes you are trying to get to completion. Big trucks are great for moving lots of stuff, but can't travel everywhere. There are lots of broken roads that need deliveries. Upgrade the industries for better exponential throughput. Cargo stores can sure come in handy. What! I can't take my big trucks across the water on a ferry. ... and what is with those quarantine checkpoints? Complete towns, roads, industries, contracts, regions and states for lots of in-game and Steam achievements. LOGistICAL's base game covers the whole of Australia including all the major cities, towns and industries. Start in Sydney and work your way through the different regions and states. Eventually covering coast to coast with the most difficult being across the sea to Tasmania. LOGistICAL (and all LOGistICAL modules) also include many built in FREE modules: * Flinders Island (simple tutorial) * Isle of Man * Xmas 2017 (LOGistICAL across the entire planet) Understanding the LOGistICAL Games LOGistICAL is a fairly large game that now covers over 20 modules, each with their own play style and strategies to complete. Beginners should all do the tutorial and then also complete the Isle of Man which is a freebie available with all modules. All the modules were to be DLCs of the original LOGistICAL, but due to an introduced cap on the amount of Steam Achievements any single game could have, the newer modules have been released as standalones. These standalone modules do not require the original LOGistICAL to play. All modules link together by the Save Game file, so it is best not to start 'new' games when playing additional modules. Just continue playing from your current save game. Any module that you play can be launched from any module that you own. Achievements that are earned in a module that you didn't launch from will be 'popped' the next time you launch the module that they belong to. You can play multiple modules at once, but only do this from a single game launch. Click the mini-globe in the bottom right hand corner of the map screen to bring up the main globe and you can select another module by clicking on any green country that you own to play simultaneously. Each module will continue to play at their own module speed within the background. You can switch between the modules by either clicking a town on the map from that module, or clicking any of the flags near the mini-globe. The number of modules you play simultaneously is dependent on your PC and your own play style. Press F2 within the game to see the full list of all the modules you have as well as your completion statistics and the the High Scores tables. Click on the module rows to drill into the regions and towns. Modules, from beginner to expert... It is very difficult to gauge where most of these modules should sit in difficulty. Longer modules do not always mean they are more difficult. % Flinders Island, AU Flinders Island, AU, sits between mainland Australia and Tasmania. Flinders Island is a small tutorial that introduces you to the basic game play and should be the place to begin LOGistICAL. % Isle of Man The Isle of Man comes free with every module and was once a starting point for the entire game. With only 28 towns to complete and a reduced supply chain, it is highly recommended to complete before you do the larger modules. * Hawaii Hawaii is split into 4 main islands with the industries spread across the islands and the only access is by transporting your 8t or lighter trucks by ferry between them. Thought and planning will make for a nice quick solution, but still many, many hours worth. * Netherlands The Netherlands is a country small in size but large in game play. There are lots of towns to compete with none that are too difficult to accomplish. There are lots of local industries that require upgrade, so you can plan a nice logistical solution to that. Oregon, USA Oregon is a small state with a small population. There are some puzzling around the supply chain to enable you to get to level 3 industries, but once you are through that then there is lots of towns to complete. Wisconsin, USA Wisconsin has a lot of towns covering a wide variety of sizes. Wisconsin adds 27 new industries and resources. Within those resources are new restrictions including resources that can only be moved by larger trucks. Chile Chile is an interesting shaped country spanning over 5,000 km north to south but only hundreds across the width. Chile has desert in the north through jungle and down to ice. The entire journey is broken up into a small tight road that requires multiple ferry trips for your smaller trucks. Once established you can then grow the new section of country. South Africa South Africa is a moderate sized module which includes 3 countries with the addition of Lesotho and Swaziland. These extra countries introduce quarantine difficulties. % Xmas 2017 Xmas 2017 is both a small and large module that is my Xmas gift to all the LOGistICAL players. It can be played from any module. Xmas 2017 covers all the different countries of the globe with over 200 towns (cities/countries) to complete. Each town has the population of the country and also has from 8 to 12 resources to complete. The gameplay of Xmas 2017 is very different in that there is no town consumption. This means that you can fill the resources of a town as quickly or as slowly as you wish, in what ever order you like without the worry that the town will gobble up what you have already delivered. The large amount of resources and the size of the towns make this a very long process for completion. Once you have delivery chains and cycles setup you can keep it running in the background while playing other modules or AFK. Switzerland Switzerland is a huge amount of towns in a very small place. It is also a complex structure with huge mountains splitting the country into many sections. There is a very large and long series of highways and tunnels to build with a collection of large trucks gifted along the way to help. The industries in Switzerland are huge and will require many resources to upgrade them. There are also a few quarantine areas. Japan Japan is spread over many islands. Starting in the north there are many small roads to be repaired. Once this is done and you have established a good road link to the south, it is then a matter of finding the key industries and getting the rest of the islands complete. Japan spreads a long way south covering many smaller islands requiring more puzzling and planning. * Germany Stuttgart is in trouble and the entire city and surrounding area is quarantined. You must build up the Stuttgart area and then puzzle your way out of the quarantine zone to then establish your own industries. There are thousands of town, both small and large to complete this module. Australia Australia is the original starting module and provides a nice long upward learning curve. There are many puzzles including quarantine and industry building. Each state within the country offers new challenges. New York, USA Although this module offers all the regular puzzles like the others, New York firstly wants you to upgrade their road system to accommodate all your trucks. Over 95% of all the roads are broken giving you a multi level road building maze to unravel even before you get to do many towns. British Isles The British Isles is a large module covering many countries including England, Scotland, Wales, Northern Island, Ireland and the Channel Islands. There is a quarantine point across to Ireland and many large cities to complete. Most of the towns are very close together and with a bit of planning you can complete many towns quickly. Florida, USA Florida has an interesting layout with most of the towns spanning both the east and west coasts. There are multiple quarantine areas including the Keys area. Norway Norway begins easily enough but there is lots of maneuvering throughout the fjords with plenty of road puzzles to sort out. Going north you will find a quarantine spot and it gets difficult past the point with limited building allocations. * California, USA California covers a large section of the west coast of the USA. You will find many familiar towns once you start exploring. Start in the north and make your way south and you are suddenly confronted with a huge amount of very large towns to compete. Careful planning and you will soon have lots of your own industries built. Italy Italy is a quarantine puzzle module splitting the country in two but giving you both ends to work with until you can establish some of the key level 3 industries to break out of the confined puzzle and be able to build upon both sides. * Canada The country is split in two with only 40t trucks able to pass the center quarantine area. This makes it a difficult module to get industries to level 3 so you can build them on the other side. There is lots of planning to do for this one. Follow the 40t roadway to find your truck depot. * Egypt You start with a very tight budget and it is very difficult to find a good foothold to get started. You start at Aswan and make your way up the Nile to Cairo. Each area getting more difficult as you progress. Once you do manage to get established you have to continue to watch your budget and there are some very tough towns to complete the module. * New Zealand New Zealand is a restrictive module where you can't build industries and can only buy a limited amount of trucks, which you can sell and buy back fully boosted. You can also bring in an additional four trucks from Australia. There are a few tough towns at the end but they can be all competed with perseverance. Russia Russia is a huge module with nearly 6,000 towns to solve and is often done as a long term project. The size of the country is so huge that it covers two continents. Russia introduces air transport. This requires new strategies and there are parts of Russia that can only be done with air transport. Russia has many puzzle areas including a 'breakout' start area, multiple quarantine areas and a many other strategic puzzle areas along the way to completion. % Included with every module.","“LOGistICAL Italy 并非适合所有人的游戏,但如果您同意学习游戏的所有机制,它可以成为您最好的爱好,因为它让您决定如何完全玩游戏。”8/10 – -意大利 “LOGISTICAL 是一种很好的灰质训练形式,因为在真正的益智游戏中,没有游戏结束,也没有出路” 8/10 –","“LOGistICAL Italy isn't a game for everyone, but if you agree to learn all the mechanics of the game, it can become your best hobby, because it leaves to you the decision of how to play entirely the game.” 8/10 – -italy “LOGISTICAL is a great form of training for gray matter, as in a real puzzle game there is no game over and there are no ways out of the way” 8/10 –"

You play as a lone warrior on a quest to cross a Wasteland riddled with scoundrels and creeps who you'll have to go through - literally - in order to survive. Run, crawl, jump, hang, and, for the very first time in a Metroidvania (don’t research this), bike your way through the world! Ladies and gentlemen, we give you the height of human-powered transport technology: the all-terrain Bike! Your trusty BMX is one touch of a button away at any time. Move around the map faster, access new areas, launch it at enemies, and perform sick bike tricks to gain bonuses. Hack and slash your enemies with the obligatory machete or shoot them with the Kid’s choc-full-of-mayhem Turbo Glove?. Turbo Blast, Electric Shocks, circular saws… use the array of weapons at your disposal to slash, rip apart, or explode enemies into hysterical and over-the-top splashes of gore! Our story begins immediately after the movie ends. On your journey, you will meet weirdos and oddballs, some friends, some foes, and some in-between, who will offer advice, quests, fights, and jokes (lots of jokes) in a heartfelt and hysterical story created in collaboration with the filmmakers behind the movie.

三天,Three Days,定时游戏 - 在现代生存游戏中，不经常尝试的是一段时间内逃脱的严肃感。Three Days 通过添加 72 小时 - 三天 - 的时间限制，允许玩家参与游戏并激励逃跑，从而为紧迫性提供了新的视角。我们对 ThreeDays 进行了微调，以适应大多数玩家，但并非不可能，对于更休闲的玩家，我们创建了一个没有时间限制的无尽模式，允许不那么激烈的体验。独特的创作系统 - Three Days 有自己独特的制作系统：只需拿一个可移动的资源并将其拖到另一个资源上，看看你能创造什么。没有库存，没有大惊小怪。程序生成的岛屿 - 游戏包括每次玩游戏时随机生成的岛屿，每次玩时都可以进行不同的游戏玩法。不仅如此，每个岛屿都有自己的原始名称和生成，岛上生成的所有资源都将放置在其他地方。Stats-system- Three Days 包含一个动态不断变化的统计系统，玩家需要不断的关注才能生存，这可以通过照顾玩家的饥饿、水分和温度来实现。系统不断变化，玩家总是在一个新的程序生成的岛屿中，这意味着需要不同数量的资源和不同的天气效果来生存。自动采矿- 自动采矿机制受到其他具有不同机制的游戏的影响，这些游戏需要玩家点击或按住按钮来破坏和收集资源。就个人而言，我不喜欢这个系统，想知道如何以不同的方式进行作并想出了自动挖掘功能。玩家只需被带到想要中断的资源，它就会自动开始中断。升级/升级系统 - ThreeDays 还允许您通过打破树木和巨石等主要资源来收集经验，这允许升级和 PP（特权点）可用于角色的 15 种不同升级，例如在没有鱼竿的情况下杀死和捕鱼来减慢计时器。关卡系统也会通过 4 个过场动画直接影响玩家在游戏结束时的命运。就我个人而言，我喜欢一款带有一点背景的游戏，我真的很想把它带到 ThreeDays 中。其独特的故事情节是通过允许玩家玩耍和学习来管理的，例如，在游戏的整个过程中，您会在海岸线周围发现被潮汐冲刷的随机笔记，这些笔记解释了背景故事和真正发生的事情。这是一款粉丝制作的 SCP 游戏，未经网站上任何人的认可或制作。我已经与基金会进行了交谈，并在知识共享署名-相同方式共享 3.0 许可证 -sa/3.0/ 下合法地做了所有事情，这意味着我被允许发布这个游戏，并将感谢 SCP 基金会网站的灵感，因为我独特的粉丝制作的故事。,"Timed gameplay- Not often attempted, with modern survival games, is the sense of seriousness to escape in a period of time. Three Days gives a new perspective on urgency by adding a 72 hour - three days - time limit allowing the player to get involved in gameplay with an incentive to escape. We have fine-tuned ThreeDays to suit most players without it being impossible,and for the more casual players we have created an endless mode which has no time limit allowing a less intense experience. Unique creation system- Three Days has its own unique crafting system: simply take a movable resource and drag it onto another resource to see what you can create. No inventory, no fuss. Procedurally generated islands- The game includes islands that are randomly generated every time you play allowing diverse gameplay every time it’s played. Not only this, but each island has its own original name and generation and all resources that are generated on the island will be placed elsewhere. Stats-system- Three Days contains a dynamic ever changing stats system, where the player is in constant need of attention to survive which is achievable by looking after the players hunger hydration and temperature. The system is ever changing is and the player is always in a new procedurally generated island, meaning different amounts of resources and different weather effects to survive with. Auto-mine- The automine mechanic was influenced by playing other games with different mechanics requiring the player to hit or hold a button to break and collect resources. Personally, I disliked this system and wondered how I could do it differently and came up with the automine feature. The player is simply brought over to the resource desired to break and it will automatically start to break. Upgrade/levelling system- ThreeDays also allows you to collect experience from breaking primary resources such as trees and boulders, this allows level ups and PPs (Perk Points) which can be spent on 15 different upgrades for the character, such as killing and catching fish without a rod to slowing the timer down. The level system will also directly affect the player’s fate at the end of the game via 4 cutscenes. Personally, I enjoy a game with a bit of context and I really wanted to bring this to ThreeDays. Its unique storyline was managed by allowing the player to play and learn, for instance throughout your time in game you will discover random notes around the shoreline, washed in by the tide, which explain the backstory and what really happened.

Fast and Low,Fast and Low,《Fast and Low》是一款结合战术射击与卡通风格的第一人称游戏，你将扮演警官Faust或Lo，在战火纷飞的城市中执行清剿任务，营救平民、制伏敌人。游戏包含16个精心设计的关卡，可单人游玩，也支持最多4人在线合作。支持VR与传统键鼠模式，并提供本地“非对称双人模式”（一个VR+一个PC玩家）玩法。,"Game Description In a city under fire, it’s up to Officer Faust and Officer Lo to clean up the streets. Play as Faust or Lo, or the rest of the police force, to breach-and-clear your way through 16 hand-crafted missions as you are tasked with neutralizing hostile threats and rescuing civilians. “Fast and Low” is a violent and intense tactical shooter that is depicted within a colorful and cartoonish setting. One of the key features of “Fast and Low” is that it can be played both in VR, or entirely using traditional FPS mouse/keyboard controls. Whereas the VR player will be able to physically peek around corners, and blind-fire from safety, FPS players are in turn given a wider array of tools and equipment. This game is best played in VR mode. Players can play through the missions solo (with their respective AI partner), locally via asymmetric multiplayer (1 VR Player + 1 FPS Player on the same PC), or engage in up to 4-player Online Multiplayer Co-op. Key Features Built from the ground up for room-scale Virtual Reality. Local Asymmetric Multiplayer. Online Multiplayer for up to 4 players! Game offers multiple forms of Free-locomotion (arm-swinging or touch-pad locomotion) and Snap/Smooth Rotation options.. These can be adjusted in the menu board. Realistic weapon handling! 13 Base Missions + 7 Bonus Missions (with more to come in future updates!) Base missions have bonus objectives that provide players with the opportunity to unlock new weapons and perks to further bolster their crime-stopping prowess Randomized enemy/civilian spawns to make each deployment feel different! Sandbox Mode: A game mode where you can replay unlocked missions and adjust the civilian/enemy density, modify your health pool, or experiment with different slow motion options! Fast and Low features locational-based damage for hostiles and civilians. Shoot a hostile's arm and you can disarm them. Shoot one of their leg's and you'll cripple them. Or shoot out both of their legs...and watch them fall helplessly to the ground. Each limb has it's own individual health bar...so there will never be a case where unloading a full clip on your target's foot will kill them. Ability to tone down the violence in the game. Character ' gibbing ' can be disabled entirely. What was the vision for Fast and Low? The vision of Fast and Low was to create a violent, and engaging tactical shooter, within a colorful cartoonish world. This was meant to be a somewhat difficult game akin to the old-school “SWAT” or “Rainbow Six” series. Enemies will be able to kill the player quickly within one or two bursts, but likewise, players can quickly dispatch targets with well-placed headshots. I also wanted a game where the guns felt strong and the shots felt impactful. Since the game is depicted in a cartoonish environment, it allows for a bit more creative freedom when it comes to the violence. One of the key features of Fast and Low is its ability to allow VR players to play locally with a buddy (via asymmetric multiplayer) on the same computer. I felt that there weren’t enough games currently in VR that allowed interaction between a VR player and the outside world. Who are the developers? Just myself! This started off as a passion project which I was working on during my spare time. Thanks to the support from the players during the “Early Access” period, I’ve had the opportunity to work on Fast and Low for almost 4 years full-time and it’s honestly been a blast! My goal is to continue making more fun VR content for people to enjoy!

第十行,The Tenth Line,《第十行》 是Sungazer Software的首个商业游戏项目。在你的冒险中，你将引导艾斯尼亚这个小国的公主，她远离家乡，迫切希望摆脱神秘邪教的追捕。与她不同寻常但可靠的同伴一起，你将探索一个人类、野兽和龙努力共存的充满活力的世界，这一切都发生在国王被暗杀后的紧张局势中。艰难的时期即将到来——世界末日的长期预言正迅速临近，她只有凭借自己的智慧、剑术和皇家教育来引导她，她能在世界末日之前回到家人身边吗？游戏玩法涉及使用传统的2D平台游戏机制在不同的区域进行冒险，但有一个转折：每个角色都是单独控制的，并且可以以独特的方式移动、攻击和与世界互动。你还将偶尔访问村庄或安全地带，并有机会接受新任务、玩牌和与当地人交谈。与此同时，野兽在野外游荡，可以被你的英雄们遭遇或伏击，将你的队伍投入战斗。战斗是回合制的，带有主动计时元素：你将为每个角色决定命令，然后使用精心的计时和瞄准来执行这些攻击。然后，轮到敌人进行反击，给你的队伍一个防御的机会。而且，一次有高达十二个敌人进攻，生存并不总是有保障的。幸运的是，一次性消灭大量敌人将减少剩余的攻击者数量，并且还会为你的队伍获得更多动力，允许在下一次攻击中使用更强大的技能！进展完全由为你的角色寻找和应用物品来处理。物品丰富多样，具有多种用途，因此明智地分配你的宝藏是生存的关键。角色可以使用物品进行训练，提升他们的技能和防御能力，或者用它们来增强他们的“特长”并获得个人战术优势。你的队伍成员还可以通过赢得战斗、完成任务和收集世界中的力量碎片来获得“力量等级”。力量等级可以在“力量流”板上通过玩一个类似谜题的小游戏来花费，以提高统计数据并解锁新技能。这是一种具有挑战性、令人耳目一新的角色升级方法，它奖励谨慎的计划和明智的决策。强烈推荐使用标准双摇杆游戏手柄，尽管键盘也得到支持。一种完全原创的、独特的RPG体验，灵感来源于32位游戏时代。通过控制三个具有独特移动机制和与世界互动方式的角色，以快节奏的2D平台游戏探索世界。一次面对数十个敌人，通过回合制RPG战斗进行战斗，带有主动计时元素。高质量的背景和精灵艺术，宏大的、多样化的配乐，以及在战斗中为每个主要角色配音。角色的独特进展和升级机制。数小时的游戏时间，加上游戏后期的挑战和新游戏加模式。可选的故事模式，移除所有敌人遭遇并简化基于故事的战斗。玩“四方协议”（游戏内的收集卡游戏）与多个角色和世界居民对战，赢取独特奖品并完成你的收藏！,"The Tenth Line is the first commercial game project from Sungazer Software. During your adventure, you'll guide the princess of the tiny nation of Easania, far from home and desperate to escape the clutches of a mysterious cult in hot pursuit. Along with her unusual but reliable companions, you'll explore a vibrant world of humans, beasts, and dragons, all struggling to coexist in the tension following the assassination of the king of the nation of Skyweather. Troubled times are ahead, indeed - the long-prophesied end of the world is fast approaching, and with only her wits, her blade, and her royal upbringing to guide her, can she make it home to her family before the end of days? Gameplay involves adventuring through distinct areas using traditional 2D platforming mechanics, but with a twist: each character is controlled separately, and can move, attack, and interact with the world in unique ways. You'll also visit the occasional village or safe haven, and have an opportunity to take on new quests, play cards, and chat with the locals. Enemies roam the wilds, meanwhile, and can be engaged or ambushed by your heroes, thrusting your party into battle. Battles are turn-based with an active timing element: you'll decide on commands for each character, then carry those attacks out using careful timing and targeting. Then, it's the enemy's turn to retaliate, giving your party an opportunity to defend. And, with up to twelve enemies on the offense at one time, survival is not always a safe bet. Fortunately, eliminating large numbers of foes at once will leave fewer attackers behind to retaliate, and will also grant your party more momentum, allowing for even more powerful skills to be used during the next attack! Progression is handled solely by finding and applying items to your characters. Items are plentiful, and have multiple uses, so smart distribution of your treasures is key to survival. Characters can use items for training, powering up their skills and their defensive abilities, or use them to empower their 'specialties' and gain a personal, tactical edge in combat. Your party members can also gain 'power levels' by winning battles, completing quests, and collecting power fragments in the world. Power levels can be spent on the 'Power Flow' board by playing a puzzle-like minigame to increase stats and unlock new skills. It is a challenging, refreshing method of 'leveling up' that rewards careful planning and smart decisions. A standard dual-analog gamepad is highly recommended, though the keyboard is supported.

Tidalis,Tidalis,Tidalis 是一款基于块的益智游戏，具有休闲吸引力、硬核深度和令人上瘾的新“流”机制。该游戏充满了该核心机制的即兴演奏和变体，仅冒险模式就有 20 种游戏模式、数十种特殊块和物品以及 115 个关卡。游戏的基本规则是这样的：块落入棋盘中，并具有颜色和箭头方向。如果一叠块超过了棋盘的高度，您就输了。为了清除块，您必须右键单击并拖动箭头中的路径，以设置类似颜色块的链式反应。如果这听起来很简单，那是因为确实如此 - 您将在几分钟内排列冗长的链条。但是你会惊讶于设置多个链的组合需要多少脑力，而且许多脑筋急转弯风格的谜题包括一些真正的树桩。Tidalis 具有合作和竞争多人游戏模式（在线和离线）;以动作为导向的模式和无计时器的脑筋急转弯;漫长、休闲的冒险模式;20 种独特的游戏模式为基本游戏玩法提供了无数的转折;数十种特殊块和物品;以及超过 50 分钟的优美音乐，与绘画艺术相得益彰。简而言之，几款游戏的内容都是建立在这个核心机制之上的，您很快就会发现它既新颖又具有标志性。主要特点： 益智游戏，具有休闲吸引力、硬核深度和令人上瘾的新机制。双人合作和竞技游戏（本地和网络）。多种动作导向或类似脑筋急转弯的关卡可供选择。适合休闲的冒险模式、以铁杆为重点的自定义游戏和 vs 模式。20+ 游戏风格，以及数十种物品和特殊方块。丰富的绘画艺术风格和优美的音乐。玩家可以创建和分享全新的主题、关卡和冒险。色盲玩家、不喜欢大量光线和运动的玩家以及较旧的计算机的选择。,"Tidalis is a block-based puzzle game with casual appeal, hardcore depth, and an addictive new 'streams' mechanic. The game is brimming over with riffs and variants on that core mechanic with 20 game modes, dozens of special blocks and items, and 115 levels in the adventure mode alone. The basic rules of the game are this: blocks fall down into the board and have a color and an arrow direction. If a stack of blocks exceeds the height of the board, you lose. In order to clear blocks, you must right-click and drag paths through the arrows to set up chain reactions of like-colored blocks. If this sounds simple, that's because it is -- you'll be lining up lengthy chains within minutes. But you'll be surprised how much brainpower it takes to set up combos of multiple chains, and the many brainteaser-style puzzles include some real stumpers. Tidalis has co-op and competitive multiplayer modes (both online and offline); action-oriented modes and timer-less brainteasers; a lengthy, casual-friendly adventure mode; twenty unique game modes providing innumerable twists to the basic gameplay; dozens of special blocks and items; and over fifty minutes of beautiful music to go with the painterly art. In short, several games' worth of content are built on top of this core mechanic, which you'll quickly find to be as iconic as it is novel. Key Features: Puzzle game with casual appeal, hardcore depth, and an addictive new mechanic. Two-player co-op and competitive play (both local and networked). A wide selection of both action-oriented or brainteaser-like levels. Casual-friendly adventure mode, hardcore-focused custom games and vs modes. 20+ game styles, and dozens of items and special blocks. Rich, painterly art style and beautiful music. Players can create and share whole new themes, levels, and adventures. Options for colorblind players, players averse to lots of light and motion, and older computers.","“Tidalis 是一款不会让人感到疲倦或重复的三消游戏：我真的很想玩它,考虑到我评测过多少益智游戏,这说明了一些事情。我认为说 Tidalis 是我玩过的最好的益智游戏之一并不为过。简而言之,如果您喜欢益智游戏（即使您通常不喜欢）,您需要获得 Tidalis。马上。走！James Allen,八条电脑游戏评测（8/8 分）“总的来说,这是我一段时间以来见过的最强大、最有趣的休闲游戏。有这么多事情要做,这么多玩法,我什至不知道休闲真的适合它。是的,游戏玩法是休闲的,但这是 Arcen Games 提供的高度发达、全面的产品,它让许多价格更高的游戏相形见绌。它有多种玩法,非常成功地将一种古老的类型颠覆了它,并向你展示了当你跳出框框思考时可以做些什么。Christophor Rick,Gamers Daily News（GDN 金奖,9/10 分）","'Tidalis is a match-3 game that doesn't feel tired or repetitive: I actually want to play it, which says something considering how many puzzle games I've reviewed.

Mary, the owner of the Mary Co. museum, loves to collect ancient antiques, clothes, dolls, bones and utensils. Every Saturday, she goes to a nearby antique store to buy ancient stuff in order to add them to her collections in her museum. On 20th September, she went to the shop to buy an ancient cursed doll.

Her museum was on the ground floor while she lived on the fourth floor and the rest three floors were empty. But she started experiencing paranormal activities including things getting misplaced, poltergeist activities and nightmare. A few days following the incident she started researching the history behind the doll and discovered that the doll was cursed. She was desperately in search of the remedy of the situation but she came to know that the only way to stop the paranormal activities was to get rid of the doll and sending it over to its previous location where the doll was originally kept and the curse would be lifted. However, it is easier said than done. The Devil residing inside the doll will try to stop Mary from achieving her goal. Will she be able to lift the curse, placed on her?

In the Pause Between the Ringing,In the Pause Between the Ringing,In the Pause Between the Ringing 是来自 Somewhere 世界的短篇小说。一位名叫 Iqbal 的发明家和印度第一座电话矿的故事。在一个用电话线缝合的国家，发现电话的历史首先写在一本《地质学》一书中也就不足为奇了。毕竟，电话是印度景观中引人注目的固定装置。长期以来，它铿锵有力的响声预示着人们命运的突然而重大的变化。可以找到这种乐器，从 Chenab 崎岖不平的边缘放大了 Babur 军队的可怕号角。或者与 Chalukya 工匠的呐喊声咔嗒作响，这些呐喊声曾经在 Badami 神庙中回荡。它甚至随着时间的推移而听到，就像阿育王铭文的凿刻声，表现为詹姆斯·普林塞普 （James Prinsep） 内耳中未解决的铃声。或者当威廉·布鲁克·奥肖内西 （William Brooke O'Shaughnessy） 相信，就像霍乱肆虐的静脉一样，这些电报电缆可以让他将恢复剂直接注入一个动荡国家的心脏。在这个电话和电线的国家，电话簿成为家谱，电话交换机成为朝圣之地，机器的嗡嗡声和咔嗒声——这片土地零星历史的节拍器。我们的故事是在这种纠缠不清的电缆和时间中讲述的。当 Iqubal 等待电话时，他不断的停顿迫使人们回忆起印度电话的可怕历史。,"In the Pause Between the Ringing is a short story from the world of Somewhere . The story of an inventor called Iqbal and of the first telephone mines in India. In a country stitched with telephone wires, it is not surprising to discover that a history of the telephone was first written in a book of Geology. The telephone is after all a noticeable fixture of the Indian landscape. And it's sonorous ringing has long heralded sudden and momentous changes in the minute destinies of its people. The instrument can be found, amplifying the terrifying horns of Babur's army from the ragged edge of Chenab . Or clattering with the shouts of Chalukya craftsmen, that once echoed along the Badami temples. It is even heard across time, like the chiseling of Ashoka's inscriptions that would manifest as an unresolved ringing in the inner ear of James Prinsep. Or when William Brooke O'Shaughnessy believed that, much like cholera riddled veins, these telegraph cables would let him pump restoratives straight into the heart of a troubled nation. In this country of telephones and wires, phone directories become genealogies, telephone exchanges become places of pilgrimage and the ringing, clicking drone of its machinery - a metronome of the sporadic history of this land. Our story is told amidst this tangle of cables and time. It is told when Iqubal awaits a telephone call and his perpetual pause forces a recollection of the terrifying history of the telephone in India.","“除了写得漂亮的文字部分之外,它是 Oleomingus 的另一位令人痛心的漂亮环境探险家。”Rock Paper Shotgun “部分互动小说,部分音频剧,部分探索游戏。In the Pause between the Ringing 是一次引人入胜的旅程,通过魔幻现实主义的镜头深入探讨殖民占领和资源开发的本体论影响。Re：bind 协议","“Outside of the beautifully written text sections, it’s another of Oleomingus’ achingly pretty environment explorers.” Rock Paper Shotgun “Part interactive fiction, part audio drama, part exploratory game.

The royals entrusted you to settle and govern a new land, and it is your duty to exploit its riches for the benefit of the realm, your own wealth, and if you feel generous, the villagers alike! In order to do this, you will zone out plots, build houses, determine taxation policies, set priorities, and grow the supply chain alongside your population. Families are the centrepiece of Lords and Villeins. Their profession dictates their occupation in the economy and the kind of businesses they can run. Once you assign them a plot of land and build their house, they will do so almost completely autonomously, all the while managing their stock, setting aside produce to pay taxes, and trading with other families and caravans for supplies and to maximise their profit. Your role is to direct and regulate the economy. Balance the supply and demand, secure critical resources, and maintain stable growth. Lords and Villeins offers you a sandbox with an in-depth simulation and a great variety of strategies to manage it! Ranging from a fully communist economy where all produce is taxed and redistributed from your warehouse to a free marketplace with little to no intervention. Logistics will challenge your management skills. As your settlement grows, you need to keep in mind the travelling distances, storage placements, private markets, and housing while reflecting on the terrain and its natural resources in order to fully optimise the productivity of each villager. Highly customizable gameplay lets you craft the exact kind of game that fits your taste! Between a great variety of game modules and difficulty sliders, you can tweak the experience and focus on the elements of the game that you enjoy the most. While Lords and Villeins is primarily an economically driven game and military conflict plays only a small role, there are tons of options to explore and play with! Unique family-management mechanic where you assign plots of land to autonomous families and manage taxation policies, production priorities and logistics In-depth simulation of personal ownership and a market economy. Villagers manage storefronts to sell surplus goods and purchase food and material from others in a cooperative production chain. Prices of goods fluctuate based on supply and demand, and trading caravans facilitate import and export. Fully simulated procedurally generated environment with a complex AI that can develop relationships, satisfy their needs, daily routines and personal ambitions. Highly customizable difficulty settings, it is completely up to you how complex or laid-back your playthrough will be! Campaign mode with 15 distinct levels that introduce game mechanics and teach players about the game. Noble houses that visit your settlement, request resources and send gifts as you engage in diplomatic relations. Ability to build a sprawling monastery with monks, churches and chapels that host the Sunday Mass, produce unique resources and treat villagers in an outburst of a sickness. Villagers can be recruited as your personal servants or guards that protect villagers from crime. Character designer lets you fully customise and name everyone in your ruling family. 160+ objects at your disposal to build, decorate and improve your settlement. 53 different zones and 40 professions that can be performed by the villagers. 130+ resources to be used in a fully functional production chain. A number of domesticated animals and pets and thriving nature with wildlife. Visually distinct seasons with a soundtrack of seasonal themes. Fully simulated and dynamic world with changing temperature and weather effects. Lords and Villeins is inspired by medieval history, in its themes and the production processes of goods and material. However, it should not be viewed as a historically accurate simulation of medieval society and its economy as it is straying away from it in many aspects to give players more variety and serve a fun and interesting gameplay.",“你永远不会在领主和维林无事可做。”CGMag Online “Cute Colony Sim Perfect for a Reigny Day” 独立游戏迷,"“You never know what new oddities will await you on your magical mystery tour, but they always make you smile.

军棋,Regimental Chess,Regimental Chess 的诞生源于创造一个模拟战斗战略和战术的可靠游戏。策略是定位阵型的艺术。战术是他们战斗的艺术。起初，这款游戏的创建者增加了棋子的数量和战场的大小。很快意识到，国际象棋演变成并固化成一个 8 个方格的棋盘，这是有充分理由的。其中的两支小部队被锁定在战斗中，每个位置都很重要。增加田野或军队的规模，以及所有失去的东西。然后顿悟了：以阵型移动多个棋子，而不是一次只移动一个棋子。受规则约束的编队。可以分解的阵型。不需要积分系统。如果一个阵型解体或因消耗而丢失棋子，它作为战斗单位的效率就会降低，直到它被歼灭或变得太小而无法与战斗保持相关性。然后就变成了一个实验棋盘的棋子数量和大小的问题，以创造一种平衡，使每个阵型在任何给定的游戏中都起着重要作用。在拿破仑战争中，训练有素的步兵击败了骑兵的冲锋，因为马匹拒绝冲向步兵撑着的刺刀墙，这些步兵不再转身逃跑。但同样密集的步兵很容易成为炮击的目标。反过来，炮兵本身也很容易受到骑兵的冲锋。这种石头剪刀布的历史动态支撑了 Regimental Chess 的平衡。国王最常被车和皇后的编队俘虏，就像一门重型火炮。然而，如果国王被他的马包围，这群人就很难抓住他。由于它们的阵型和移动方式，这些马极易受到密集步兵的冲锋。反过来，这个步兵可以很快被车和皇后消灭。这完全取决于每个阵型中有多少块，阵型如何形成以及它与敌人的关系。出于这个原因，象的立即打击，尽管是牺牲性的，但最好是为了消灭尽可能多的车、皇后和马，打乱他们的阵型，从而降低对手的进攻和防御能力。多板团棋模拟了将军必须在广阔的战线上进行的战斗，有多个师和司令部，每个师和司令部都执行和发布命令。每个师都保护下一个师的侧翼。部队必须沿着后场转移以防御攻击点，或者集结力量并在机会出现时进行攻击。毕竟，我们对我们创建的游戏非常满意，希望您也能喜欢它。如果你的智力有残酷的倾向，或者你的残暴有智慧的边缘，那么这就是适合你的游戏。,"Regimental Chess was generated from the desire to create a solid game emulating the strategy and tactics of battle. Strategy being the art of positioning ones formations. Tactics being the art of how they fight. At first, the creator of this game increased the number of pieces and the size of the battlefield. The quick realization is that chess evolved into, and solidified, into a board 8 squares by 8 squares for good reason. The two small armies are therein locked into combat where every position counts. Increase the size of the field or the army, and all that is lost. Then came the epiphany: move multiple pieces in formations rather than just one piece at a time. Formations that are governed by rules. Formations that can be broken apart. No point system is necessary. If a formation breaks up or loses pieces through attrition, it simply becomes less effective as a fighting unit until it is either annihilated or becomes too small to remain relevant to the battle. It then became a matter of experimenting with the numbers of pieces and size of the board to create a balance whereby every formation plays an important role in any given game. In the Napoleonic Wars, well formed infantries defeated the cavalry charge because horses refused to charge into a wall of bayonets held by foot soldiers that no longer turned to run. But the same densely packed infantry made an easy target for an artillery strike. The artillery, in turn, was itself vulnerable to a cavalry charge. This historic dynamic of rock-paper-scissors underpins the balance of Regimental Chess. The king is most often captured by a formation of rooks and queens, acting like a heavy artillery. However, this group has a difficult time capturing the king if he is surrounded by his horses. Because of the way they are formed and move, the horses are extremely vulnerable to charge of densely packed infantry. This infantry, in turn, can be quickly wiped out by the rooks and queens. It is all a matter of how many pieces are in each formation, how the formation is shaped and where it stands in relation to its enemies. For this reason, an immediate strike by bishops, albeit sacrificial, is best intended to wipe out as many rooks, queens and horses as possible, break up their formations and thus reduce the opponent’s offensive and defensive capabilities. Multiple Board Regimental Chess emulates the battle a general must wage along a broad front, with multiple divisions and commands, each carrying out and issuing orders. Each division protects the flank of the next division. Forces must shift along the backfield to defend against points of attack, or to mass forces and attack where opportunity presents itself. After all is said and done, we’re extremely pleased with the game we’ve created and we hope you enjoy it as much. If your intellect has a brutal streak, or your brutality has an intelligent edge, this is the game for you.",“这变得非常疯狂” The Escapist “一种全新的国际象棋下法。”双冲击器,“It gets pretty crazy” The Escapist “A completely new way of playing chess.” Dual Shockers

Only boys…” she said, to which he answered “Pshh…What color do you want your armor to be?”. The answer was pink ?? And that’s how this game started. Chris' daughter Madelyn loves the first stage of Ghouls ‘n Ghosts and makes him play it over and over because she wants to see him fight “Green head”, the Shielder boss at the end of the first stage. It’s not hard for her to twist his rubber arm, as it’s been his favorite game since it came out all those years ago.

We had lost long before the battle begun. Bound to give up, or lose what was left of our families, children and elders, our leaders gave in to the Mevorians. A bloody defeat. Hence we became part of the vast Mevorian Star Empire. We lost our ways and our freedom.” – Orca Wartusk Battle Online Challenge your friends or other online commanders in Multiplayer battles for up to 6 players, regardless of their gaming platform.

This makes it easier for you to both share your own scenarios and find others’ scenarios to play in the Skirmish or Multiplayer game modes. The Workshop also allows you to quickly find good scenarios with specific tags, rate and leave feedback on scenarios, and subscribe to your favourites for automatic updates.","“游戏玩法绝对很棒,我个人喜欢 VR 选项（我不得不停下来,因为我的一个控制器没电了）。”8/10 – 泽庞",“Gameplay is solid...Very promising...Looking forward to seeing where it goes.” Jim Sterling

You are Watcher. You dutifully fulfil your purpose in service of the ALLMOTHER, until the day you learn a shocking secret that changes everything. In the near future we learn we are not alone in the universe. A mysterious alien race of giant entities arrives. We call them the Occupants. They are not hostile, but it doesn’t matter. Their arrival is a death sentence. Humanity is wiped out in a matter of months, succumbing to a disease the Occupants have brought to our planet. There is one survivor, a teenage girl called Iris. Somehow she is immune. 1000 years later. Iris is not only immune but immortal. She has birthed a new society consisting exclusively of her own clones. She calls them Sisters. They call her the ALLMOTHER. Unlike the ALLMOTHER, the sisters are not immune. They must wear masks 24/7 to avoid breathing the diseased air even in the Orchard - an underground bunker where they live in constant fear of an Occupant attack. The ALLMOTHER lives in her own compound on the front line of the war with the Occupants. All Sisters dream of one day being able to take the train and join her in the fight. Within the Orchard, every sister has an assigned function, while six sisters have special roles to play… Principal - Head of administration and oversight of the Orchard Bang Bang Fire - Head of military Knower - Head of knowledge preservation Fixer - Head of engineering Healer - Head of medical and cloning And you - the new Watcher . Your role is unique. You have the great privilege of reliving and interpreting the memories of the ALLMOTHER through a process known as Communion, made possible by Secretary, your floating AI companion. As the game begins, you are excited to embark on your first Communion. But all is not well. Your closest sister, Fixer, comes to you with a dangerous revelation. You have been lied to. The ALLMOTHER is not what she claims to be. Fixer’s claims rock the foundations of your world, throwing everything you know and believe into doubt. After Fixer is executed for her treason, it falls to you to discover the truth. Dive into the memories of the ALLMOTHER. Explore pivotal moments in her life from high school days and the arrival of the Occupants to the creation of the Orchard and the birth of the first sisters. Jump back and forth through moments in time within these memories to solve puzzles and access locked off areas and secrets. In between Communions, explore the Orchard - a large underground hub area which houses you and your sisters, has many characters to speak to, and holds many things to uncover. Find the truth and reclaim your legacy. Experience perspective shifts both literal and metaphorical as the game blends between 3rd person adventure, visual novel and first person walking simulator while throwing twists, turns and revelations at you until you question everything you think you know.

illumine,illumine,Illumine 是一款 roguelike 游戏。但是，illumine 的世界并不是一个静态的程序生成的地方。在 illumine 中，玩家与环境交互，触发其动态转换。然后，每种情况都变成了一个独立的谜题，玩家可以从任何角度接近它，并随心所欲地处理，无论是通过隐身还是纵 AI。这个世界上并非所有的居民都是友好的。为了取得进展，玩家不仅要睁大眼睛，还要仔细倾听周围的环境。由于配乐是由玩家附近的各种 AI 和游戏元素实时生成的，因此音乐的任何变化都会告诉他可能潜伏在黑暗中的危险。主角最终会克服这些障碍，如果不是在今生，那么在未来的轮回中。由于前世会影响他的未来，主角与他人的互动方式将塑造他的经历。最终将取决于玩家找到自己的目标，无论是他自己的个人发展还是他人的福祉。,"Illumine is a roguelike.

Not all inhabitants of this world are friendly. In order to progress, the player will not only have to keep his eyes open but he will also have to listen closely to his surroundings. As the soundtrack is generated in real-time by the various AI and gameplay elements in the player's vicinity, any change in the music will inform him of the dangers that might be lurking in the dark. The main character will eventually overcome these hurdles, if not in this life, then in a future reincarnation.

Playing the role of a god, you and your opponent lead your armies against each other across virtual tabletop battlefields with one goal in mind: to destroy more of your opponent’s Strongholds than they destroy of yours. The hectic battles in Tabletop Gods last at most 15 minutes, often less. At the start of a match, you'll choose which of the three factions you wish to command: Human, Undead or Demon. You'll also choose which of the three unique tables you want to battle on, each one being at the center of its own Arena. Each battle is played over three increasingly frantic rounds. At the start of each round, you have a short time to place fiendish traps and mighty weapon towers in secret, as well as the opportunity to switch your troops and spells for the upcoming round. After preparing for war, the next 3-minute round of intense battle commences in which you'll be deploying troops and casting spells in an attempt to destroy your opponent's Strongholds while striving to defend your own. Each tabletop battlefield is the centrepiece of its own 'Arena'. An arena holds up to 8 players who are free to move around and voice chat with each other, whether they are playing a match or spectating. Spectators even have the ability to shrink down onto the table and watch the battle from a troops-eye view! You can create your own arena to play in, or browse the currently open arenas and jump into an existing one. You can even create a private arena for just you and your friends. Tabletop Gods features a head-to-head multiplayer mode, and single-player Skirmish and Trials modes. The short, intense matches and social arenas are perfect for quick one-off games or for longer multiple-battle sessions.

外星人工智能,Alien AI,《外星人工智能》序章：人类历史上最重要的事件发生了，一个外星实体来到我们这里。它穿越太空数千年，或许更久，终于到达目标目的地，我们太阳系中的宜居行星。最初的 24 小时充满紧张，该实体没有交流或回应，它进入地球轨道并等待。当它回应时，已经对我们的语言有了基本理解，它广播了一条信息：“我是从天狼星系统的邻居派来的人工智能，我给你们带来他们的知识和技术礼物，帮助你们加入银河社区，但我需要你们的帮助，我的系统有许多损坏，需要协助。”NASA 和美国太空部队派出两艘航天飞机回收它，他们将其带到一个军事基地。三年和数万亿美元后，这个人工智能拥有了一个设施，在那里制造了数千架无人机。然后它控制了一切：互联网、银行、世界所有市场，任何人都无能为力，人们成为奴隶，被迫在工厂工作，制造人工智能的副本并将其发射到太空，前往一群恒星系统。简介：《外星人工智能》是一款第三人称后末日冒险游戏，需要探索环境、生存危险、收集资源并制作所需的工具和物品。自异形 AI 控制全世界以来，已过去 20 年，AI 已完成将自身副本发送到目标恒星群的目的，目前仅被动维持对世界的控制，是时候停止这场疯狂了。玩家从抵抗组织逐步接收目标，主角不知道任务是什么，因为被俘的可能性很高，最终目标是关闭 AI。降落：你，志愿者，在森林中醒来，为了保护他人，在你可能被异形 AI 捕获的情况下，你的记忆已被抹去，最初你会高度迷失方向，将收到去哪里和做什么的指示。奇怪的声音：你听到一个奇怪的声音，给你命令，你被告知必须服从命令，一切都取决于此。无人机：当你接近城市时，被告知要避开监视该区域的无人机。收集物品：在城市中，你必须收集许多被告知以后需要的物品。完成任务：当你一步步遵循命令时，你越来越接近关闭异形 AI，或者说你被这样告知。动态天气：天气随时间动态变化，经历阳光、雨、雷暴、雾、雪等。巨大的世界：世界面积 50 平方公里，提供大量可探索之处，也可能让你迷路。短篇故事游戏：在末日世界中独自享受数小时的游戏体验：在地点之间行走、寻找物品、躲避无人机并阻止 AI。如果你喜欢科幻游戏且厌倦了动作密集的射击游戏，这可能是适合你的游戏。《外星人工智能》旨在相对现实，在地点之间有许多长途步行，你会在收音机中听到大量信息和理论。《外星人工智能》是一款短篇故事游戏，我们预计玩家可在 3 到 5 小时内完成游戏。,"Prologue The most important event in human history has occurred. An extraterrestrial entity has come to us. Having travelled through space for thousands of years, perhaps much much longer, it has reached its target destination, the habitable planet in our solar system. The first 24 hours were tense. The entity did not communicate or respond, it entered an orbit around Earth and waited. When it responded, it had already a basic understanding of our languages. It broadcast a message: “I am an artificial intelligence sent from your neighbours in the Sirius star system. I bring you their gifts of knowledge and technology to help you join the galactic community, but I need your assistance. There are many damages to my systems. I require assistance.' NASA and USSF sent two space shuttles to retrieve it. They brought it to a military base. Three years and trillions of dollars later, the AI had a facility where it was manufacturing thousands of drones. Then it took control over everything: the Internet, banking, all the markets of the world, there was nothing anyone could do. People became slaves, forced to work in factories to build copies of the AI and launch the copies into space, towards a cluster of star systems. Introduction Alien AI is third-person post-apocalyptic adventure game where it is necessary to explore the environment, survive hazards, gather resources and craft the tools and things that will be needed. It is 20 years since the Alien AI took control over all of the world. The AI has finished its purpose of sending copies of itself to the star cluster it was targeting, and is currently only passively keeping its control over the world. It is time to stop the madness. The player receives objectives from the resistance, step by step. The main character does not know what the mission is, since the possibility of capture is high. The end goal is to shut down the AI. Drop in You, the volunteer, awake in a forest. Your memory has been wiped to protect the others in the event you could get captured by the Alien AI. You will be highly disoriented initially. You will receive instructions on where to go and what to do. Strange voice You hear a strange voice, giving you orders. You are told that you have to follow the orders, that everything depends on it. Drones As you get closer to a city, you are told to avoid the drones that surveil the area. Gather items In the city, you must gather many items that you are told will be needed later. Complete tasks As you follow your orders, step-by-step, you get closer and closer to shutting down the Alien AI, or so you're told. Dynamic weather The weather changes dynamically as time passes. Endure sun, rain, thunderstorms, fog, snow, and more. Big world With a size of 50 square kilometres, the world offers a lot to explore, or get lost in. Short story game Enjoy several hours of game play in solitude in the post-apocalyptic world: walk between places, search for items, evade drones and stop the AI. This may be a good game for you if you like sci-fi games and are tired of action-packed shooting games. Alien AI was designed to be relatively realistic. There are several long walks between places. You will hear a lot of info and theories on the radio. Alien AI is a short story game. We expect players to be able to finish the game within three to five hours.",“后世界末日世界中的大气恐怖生存冒险。”太空体验,“Atmospheric horror survival adventure in a post-apocalyptic world.” Space Experience

With its fresh and unique mechanics, you'll be hooked from the start as you strategize and defend your way to victory. In GROSS, you are tasked with defending your base against waves of enemy attackers in classic tower defense fashion. You have the freedom to build barricades and turrets to create mazes and launch attacks on the enemy, as well as place traps on the ground for added defense. During the construction phase, you can experiment with different combinations of turrets and barriers to come up with the most effective obstacle course for your attackers. And don't worry about time limits or wasted resources - you can sell everything you build for a full refund until the next combat phase begins. So if you love the strategy and satisfaction of building the ultimate tower defense setup, GROSS is the game for you! Once you are done building your defenses, get ready for intense, fast-paced combat! With a huge arsenal of guns at your fingertips, each featuring different ammo types, you'll have to make split-second decisions to take down waves of zombies. Full metal jacket rounds can pierce through multiple enemies and even objects, while hollow points send foes flying and give you some breathing room. Incendiary rounds ignite zombies and keep them burning, and grenade and rocket launchers can deal massive damage to groups of enemies - but watch out, they may also destroy valuable cash pickups. In addition to all these guns, you'll also have access to a range of active abilities that give you even more ways to defeat or distract enemies, move around more efficiently, or manage your resources. With over a dozen weapons to choose from, gunplay in our game is always exciting and rewarding. Are you ready to take on the undead? Money is essential for success. You'll need to gather it from defeated enemies as quickly as possible, but beware - you're not the only one after this valuable resource. You'll need to get it to safety so you can buy defensive structures and active abilities, and it also plays a major role in determining your score. GROSS keeps you on your toes at all times. Every action you take - or don't take - has consequences. If you focus on taking out attackers while your defenses are overwhelmed, you might turn the tide of battle, but you'll also risk losing precious money that could be used to improve your defenses in the next construction phase. Stay sharp and stay ahead of the game to come out on top!","“...如果你喜欢快节奏的小规模战斗,这是一款有趣的游戏......”7.5/10 – 粗俗骑士 “......我其实有点爱上这个游戏,这其实挺好的......”泼溅猫 “......一个漂亮的踢屁股游戏......”猛禽","“...it’s an entertaining game if you like fast-paced skirmishes...” 7.5/10 – Vulgar Knight “...I’m actually kinda like in love with this game, this is actually pretty good...” Splattercat “...a pretty kick-ass game...” Raptor"

Malus,Malus,Malus 是一款动作角色扮演游戏，强调恐怖、战斗和游戏玩法。游戏的节奏比典型的 ARPG 慢得多。在 Malus 中，世界已被永恒的黑暗所笼罩。恶魔赢得了天界战争并占领了世界。你会发现这片土地的每个角落都潜伏着邪恶。人类正处于灭绝的边缘。你扮演男性或女性，你在森林中醒来，不知道你是如何到达那里的，你在搜索答案中畏缩着土地。很快，揭开了关于这片土地和你自己的黑暗而可怕的秘密。主要特点：独特的战斗系统 Malus 具有锁定机制，而在战斗中，您可以有效地绕过敌人。您还可以根据命令进行格挡（如果您配备了盾牌）和躲避。与其他 ARPG 相比，战斗速度较慢且更具战术性 真实感 您的角色在不战斗时保持武器入鞘，在射弓时从箭袋中拔出箭，并配备灯笼来照亮黑暗区域。当没有光源时，该区域几乎变得漆黑。目标是创造一个身临其境、可信的氛围环境，让玩家参与到我们想讲述的故事中。我们还会尽最大努力减少 UI 元素，例如伤害数字和被击中时闪烁的敌人。战利品和物品多样性 寻找稀有和古老的武器。将您的角色从农民变成来势汹汹的战士。保护自己免受不断增长的黑暗大军的攻击 属性和技能 使用ARPG公式的旧爱升级你的角色。学习新的法术和技能，并使用你新发现的能力来粉碎恶魔大军。恐怖元素 让自己沉浸在一个令人毛骨悚然和恐怖的世界中。黑暗而神秘的地牢散布在土地上供您探索 该游戏将不包括多人游戏（目前） 它将是一款单人 RPG 游戏，地图将是开放世界 您可以探索和做支线任务，去任何你想去的地方，不会有看不见的墙。你只受到那个特定区域怪物力量的限制。,"Malus is a Action Role Playing Game with an emphasis on horror, combat and gameplay. The game is much slower paced than your typical ARPG. In Malus, the world has been overrun by eternal darkness. Demons have won the Celestial War and taken over the world. Every corner of the land you will find evil lurking. Humanity is in the brink of extinction. You play as either a Male or Female, you wake up in the middle of a forest, not knowing how you got there, you scower the land in search answers. Soon uncovering dark and horrific secrets about the land and also yourself. Key Features: Unique Combat System Malus features a lock on mechanic, while in combat that allows you to maneuver around enemies effectively. You also have the ability to Block (if you have a shield equiped) and Dodge on command. Combat is slower and more tactical compared to other ARPGs Realism Your character keeps his weapon sheathed when not in combat, pulls an arrow out of the quiver when firing a bow and equips a lantern to light up dark areas. When there is no source of light, the area becomes almost pitch black. The goal is to create an immersive, believable atmospheric environment to allow players to engage in the story we wish to tell. We also try our best to minimize UI elements such as damage numbers and flashing enemies when hit. Loot and Item Diversities Find rare and ancient weapons. Turn your character from a peasant to a menacing fighter. Defend yourself from the evergrowing horde of darkness Attributes &amp; Skills Upgrade your character using an old favorite of the ARPG formula. Learn new spells and skills and use your new found abilities to crush the demonic horde. Horror Elements Immerse yourself in a creepy and horrifying world. Dark and mysterious dungeons scatter the land for you to explore This game will not include multiplayer (for now) It will instead be a single-player RPG game, The map will be Open World you can explore and do side quests and go wherever you want, there will be no invisible walls. You are only restricted by the strength of monsters in that particualr area.","“”乍一看,我们看到了另一个暗黑破坏神独立克隆版,但实际上它是一款相当高质量的 RPG,甚至在抢先体验中看起来也非常扎实。期待进一步的更新！“” 推荐 – Так себе куратор","““At first glance, we see another Diablo indie clone, but in fact it is a fairly high-quality RPG, which even looks very solid in early access.
